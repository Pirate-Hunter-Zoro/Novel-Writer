# RWBY Novel Writer

This project is a modular, AI-powered writing pipeline designed to continue the story of *RWBY* following the events of Volume 9. It uses a multi-bot system orchestrated by a master script to generate consistent, lore-adherent chapters.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

The novel is generated chapter by chapter. Each chapter is autonomously deconstructed into five distinct parts by the primary conductor script, which then guides the content through a structured, automated pipeline:

1. **Planning** (`prompt_generator.py`)
2. **Prose Generation & Revision** (`author.py`)
3. **Quality & Lore Evaluation** (`critic.py`)
4. **Canon Archiving** (`archivist.py`)
5. **Art Prompt Generation** (`art_director.py`)

## ⚙️ System Components

### `conductor.py` - The Orchestrator

This is the master script that runs the entire chapter generation process. It calls each specialized script in sequence, manages the author-critic feedback loop, and assembles the final chapter file. After each part is approved, it calls `art_director.py` to generate a relevant art prompt.

**Usage:**
`python scripts/conductor.py --chapter-number <number>`

## 🔬 Primary Objective: Custom Art Generation

The writing pipeline is functional. The current objective is to produce stylized art for the novel. The previous method of using a local script has been abandoned as ineffective.

The new strategy is to use a Google Colab notebook to perform **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) training** with **Stable Diffusion**.

* **Goal:** Create a separate, custom-trained LoRA model for each character using the provided `training_images`.
* **Status:** The training images and their corresponding caption files are prepared. A reliable Colab notebook (Kohya's Trainer) has been identified for the training process.
* **Blocker:** The training process must be executed manually in the notebook for each of the 32 characters. This is a time-consuming but necessary procedure.

Once the LoRA models are created, the prompts generated by `conductor.py` can be used in a Stable Diffusion environment to produce stylistically consistent illustrations.

## 🗂️ Status

✅ **All Core Writing & Planning Bots Online:** The Planner, Author, Critic, Archivist, and Art Director are functional and tested.
