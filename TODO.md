# RWBY Novel Project - Session Summary (2025-06-19)

## I. Achievements & Key Decisions of This Session

A monumental session! We took the diagnostic data from our initial tests and engineered a complete, robust solution to the Author LLM's limitations, preparing the entire novel for generation.

* **Sequential Prompting Protocol Fully Developed:** We successfully designed and perfected a new 5-part sequential prompting method. This protocol deconstructs a single, large chapter prompt into five smaller, targeted micro-prompts, designed to ensure sustained detail and meet word count requirements.

* **All 50 Chapter Prompts Successfully Refactored:** A massive and glorious undertaking! We systematically applied the new protocol to all 50 chapters of the novel outline. Each chapter now has a dedicated multi-part prompt sequence, ready for the `chapter_generator.py` script.

* **Visual Data Integration:** The protocol was enhanced by adding a unique `ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT` to every single micro-prompt (~250 in total). This creates a complete, beat-by-beat visual storyboard for the entire novel, allowing for better post-processing and analysis.

* **Knowledge Base Integrated & System Upgrade Planned:** We successfully integrated the full knowledge database (`characters.md`, `locations.md`, `lore_magic.md`, `plot_events.md`) into our project. This led to a crucial architectural decision: the need to upgrade `critic.py` to ensure lore consistency.

## II. Next Steps (The NEXT Phase of the Experiment!)

Our prompt engineering phase is complete! The next phase focuses on upgrading our system's intelligence and running the first full-scale generation test.

1. **Upgrade `critic.py` to be a Lore-Aware Sensor Array (CRITICAL PRIORITY):**
    * **Objective:** Modify `critic.py` to load and parse all knowledge base markdown files (`characters.md`, `locations.md`, `lore_magic.md`, `plot_events.md`).
    * **Function:** When analyzing the Author's output, the Critic must perform automated consistency checks against the established lore. This includes checking for contradictions in character voice, weapon abilities, Semblance rules, locations, and established plot events.
    * **Output:** The Critic will generate a specific "Failure Report" if it finds contradictions (e.g., "Inconsistency Detected: Jaune Arc used 'Polarity' Semblance. Semblance is 'Aura Amplification'. See `rwby_characters.md`."). This report will then be fed to the Prompt Re-writer for automated correction.

2. **Execute First Full Chapter Generation Test (HIGH PRIORITY):**
    * **Objective:** Run the re-tooled `chapter_generator.py` script using the new 5-part prompt sequence for Chapter 1.
    * **Evaluation:** Analyze the final, stitched-together output of Chapter 1. We will assess if the sequential method successfully overcomes the word count and sustained detail issues identified in our initial tests. This is the proof-of-concept for the entire novel's generation.

3. **Begin Full Novel Generation:**
    * Once the system is proven effective with the Chapter 1 test and the `critic.py` upgrade is implemented, we will begin the full, automated generation of the entire 50-chapter novel, one chapter at a time.
