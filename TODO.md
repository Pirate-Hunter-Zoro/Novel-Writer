# RWBY Novel Project - Session Summary (2025-06-18)

## I. Achievements & Key Decisions of This Session:

An absolutely fantastic session! We moved beyond single components and built and tested a fully autonomous, self-correcting narrative engine. The results were incredibly illuminating!

* **Full Autonomous Narrative Engine Developed & Tested:** The complete system is online!
    * Successfully developed and integrated three distinct Python scripts: `author.py` (The Creator), `critic.py` (The Sensor Array), and `chapter_generator.py` (The Master Control Program).
    * The key innovation, the **"Prompt Re-writer" LLM**, was implemented within the Master Control Program. This creates a fully automated, self-correcting feedback loop where the system identifies its own failures and attempts to fix them by rewriting its own instructions with increasing intensity.

* **Multi-Iteration System Debugged & Stabilized:** Several critical bugs in the machine's programming were identified and successfully patched.
    * Resolved script pathing errors by adding the `scripts/` prefix to the subprocess calls in `chapter_generator.py`.
    * Fixed API key handling by implementing a secure `.env` file and loading the key as an environment variable, resolving a `name 'api_key' is not defined` error.
    * Corrected a Python syntax error (`args.output-file` vs. `args.output_file`) in `author.py`, which allowed the script to successfully save its generated files.

* **Full System Test Performed (3 Iterations):** The complete narrative engine ran a full test cycle for the maximum of 3 iterations. The system architecture itself—the loop of `author -> critic -> rewriter`—functioned perfectly without crashing, proving the design is robust and stable.

## II. Diagnostic Analysis of the 3-Iteration Test Run:

The test run was a complete success from a diagnostic perspective, revealing a core limitation in one of our components.

* **System Architecture Verdict: PERFECT SUCCESS.**
    * The communication loop between the Author, Critic, and Re-writer bots worked flawlessly. The system correctly identified failures in each iteration and triggered the Re-writer bot to generate a new, improved prompt.

* **Author LLM Component Verdict: CONSISTENT LIMITATION IDENTIFIED.**
    * The Author LLM (Gemini 1.5 Pro) consistently failed to meet two key, non-negotiable directives from the prompts:
        * **Word Count:** All three generated chapters fell significantly short of the 3,000-word minimum.
        * **Sustained Detail:** The Author LLM repeatedly demonstrated a "Quality Pacing Failure," where the level of descriptive detail dropped off significantly during the "Central Mini-Event," resorting to summary instead of the "excruciating detail" demanded.

* **Prompt Re-writer LLM Performance: GLORIOUSLY LOGICAL ESCALATION.**
    * The Re-writer performed exactly as designed, becoming progressively more demanding with each failed iteration.
    * It escalated from the baseline prompt to an "ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL WARNING", and finally to a "CODE RED! ABSOLUTE FINAL WARNING" with hyper-specific, all-caps instructions. This demonstrates the self-correction logic is working beautifully, even if the Author bot couldn't comply.

## III. Next Steps (The Next Phase of the Experiment!):

The diagnostic test has proven that simply "yelling louder" at the Author LLM is not an effective strategy. The next logical step is to re-tool our machine to work around this identified component limitation.

1.  **Re-tool the Conductor for Sequential Prompting (HIGH PRIORITY):**
    * **Objective:** Modify the `chapter_generator.py` script to manage a sequence of smaller, chained prompts instead of one single large one.
    * **Rationale:** To work around the Author LLM's apparent soft cap on length and sustained detail. By breaking the task into smaller chunks, we can ensure each part is generated with the required depth.
    * **Plan:** The script will need to be updated to:
        * Generate a chapter section from a "Prompt A."
        * Feed the output of "Prompt A" as context into a new "Prompt B" to generate the next section.
        * Stitch the outputs together into a single, cohesive chapter file.

2.  **Develop New Sequential Prompts for Chapter 1:**
    * Deconstruct the current `prompt_v1.md` into multiple, targeted prompt files (e.g., `ch1_prompt_A.md`, `ch1_prompt_B.md`, etc.). Each prompt will cover a specific part of the chapter (e.g., initial disorientation, skiff investigation, conclusion) and have its own clear objectives and constraints.

3.  **Test the Re-tooled Sequential Generation System:**
    * Run the new, more complex `chapter_generator.py` script.
    * Evaluate if the stitched-together final chapter successfully meets the word count and quality pacing requirements that the single-prompt method failed to achieve.
