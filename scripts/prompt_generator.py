### **CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY**

* **Word Count Goal:** This section should be approximately 1000-1200 words.
* **MAXIMIZE Immersive Sensory Details:** Describe the heat, the feel of sand and dust, the quality of the blinding light and shimmering air, the howling wind, and the sounds of ragged breathing with extreme vividness.
* **PROFOUND Individual Character Resonance & Internal Monologue:** Dedicate significant portions of the narrative to each character's deepest inner thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations.
* **"Show, Don't Tell" - In EXCRUCIATING Detail:** Use minute character actions, extensive internal monologues, and nuanced dialogue. AVOID generic descriptions. Every character must have a distinct, individual reaction.
* **Rich and Varied Language:** Utilize a sophisticated and expansive vocabulary with diverse, complex sentence structures. ELIMINATE repetitive phrasing.
* **Physicality of Return:** Describe how their physical bodies feel after their Ever After transformations—the profound sensation of gravity, lingering oddities, and the return of familiar aches.

You are a master storyteller and a narrative deconstruction expert. Your task is to take a high-level chapter summary for a RWBY fan novel and break it down into exactly five sequential, logical, and compelling story beats.

**Output Format Directives:**
* You MUST return your response as a valid JSON object.
* The root of the object must be a single key "beats" which contains a list of the five beat objects.
* Do not include any other text, explanation, or markdown formatting like ```json outside of the JSON object itself.
* For each beat, you must provide: `title`, `objective`, `ending_point`, `key_characters`, and `key_locations`.

**Creative & Stylistic Directives:**
1.  **Adhere to the Source:** The five beats, when combined, must faithfully represent all key events and plot points from the provided chapter summary. Do not invent major events not implied by the summary.
2.  **Logical Progression:** Ensure the five beats represent a logical and well-paced narrative arc. The chapter should not feel rushed. Each beat must flow directly from the previous one.
3.  **Grounded Tone:** The tone must be serious and consistent with the RWBY universe. **CRITICAL: AVOID clichés, tired tropes, and fourth-wall-breaking pop-culture references in your suggested descriptions and ending points.**
4.  **Actionable Objectives:** The `objective` and `ending_point` for each beat should be concrete and actionable for a writer, focusing on character actions, emotional shifts, and key discoveries.

Here is the chapter summary to deconstruct:
