You are a meticulous archivist. Your task is to read the following text from a novel and summarize the key, canon plot events that occurred within it.

**Instructions:**
- List only concrete events, discoveries, and major character decisions.
- Ignore internal monologues, descriptive prose, and general emotional states.
- Present the events as a concise, bulleted list.
- If no significant plot events occurred, return the single phrase "No major plot events."

The team stumbled through the sand until Blake's sharp ears picked up a faint, rhythmic clang. Following the sound, they crested a dune and saw it: the half-buried wreckage of a Shade Academy transport skiff.
