# RWBY Novel Project - Knowledge Database: Lore & Magic

## Aura
* **Description:** The manifestation of a soul, an energy field that acts as a protective force shield around individuals. It protects from physical harm (bullets, bladed weapons, blunt force) and can quickly heal minor injuries. It is finite and depletes with damage. When an individual's Aura is depleted, they become vulnerable to attacks.
* **Abilities/Uses:**
    * **Defense:** Primary protective barrier.
    * **Healing:** Accelerates the healing of minor wounds.
    * **Semblance Activation:** Powers an individual's unique Semblance.
    * **Passive Enhancement:** Constantly enhances physical capabilities like strength, speed, and durability.
* **Activation:** Can be "unlocked" by another person with an active Aura, usually a trained Huntsman or Huntress.

## Semblances
* **Description:** A unique, personal manifestation of an individual's Aura. It is an innate ability, specific to each person, and often reflects their personality or desires.
* **Cost:** Using a Semblance consumes Aura. More powerful or prolonged uses drain Aura faster.
* **Types:** Highly varied, ranging from physical enhancements (like Yang's "Burn" or Nora's "Overload") to elemental manipulation (like Weiss's "Glyphs") or unique sensory/perception abilities (like Ren's "Aura of Tranquility" or Blake's "Shadow").

## Dust
* **Description:** A naturally occurring energy propellant that exists in crystalline form. It is Remnant's primary energy source and a common component in weapons, technology, and clothing.
* **Elemental Properties:** Comes in various elemental forms, most commonly:
    * **Fire Dust:** Generates heat and flames.
    * **Water Dust:** Generates water or ice.
    * **Lightning Dust:** Generates electricity.
    * **Wind Dust:** Generates gusts of wind or air pressure.
    * Other forms exist, like Gravity Dust, Hard-Light Dust, and Ice Dust.
* **Usage:** Can be woven into clothing, used as ammunition, incorporated into weapons, or activated directly for various effects. It is inert until activated by Aura or a sudden force.

## Maidens
* **Description:** Four powerful female individuals who control immense elemental magic, tied to the four seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter). Each Maiden controls powers traditionally associated with her season (e.g., Winter Maiden controls ice and cold, Summer controls heat and light).
* **Origin:** Their powers were bestowed upon a group of four sisters by the God of Light, intended to bring good to the world.
* **Transfer of Power:** Upon a Maiden's death, her power automatically transfers to the last person in her thoughts, provided that person is female. If no female is in her thoughts, it transfers randomly to a female.
* **Limitations:** Maidens cannot fully control their powers without practice, and their magic is not limitless; it can be drained or sealed.
* **Current Status/Known Maidens:**
    * **Fall Maiden:** Cinder Fall (partial, then full after Amber's death).
    * **Spring Maiden:** Raven Branwen.
    * **Winter Maiden:** Winter Schnee (transferred from Penny, who received it from Fria).
    * **Summer Maiden:** Status unknown (presumably active somewhere, but not a direct plot focus thus far).
* **Role in Narrative:** Central to Salem's plan, as each Maiden guards access to one of the four Relics.

## Relics
* **Description:** Four ancient artifacts created by the Gods, each possessing a unique and incredibly powerful ability, tied to the four Maidens and hidden in vaults across Remnant.
* **Types & Abilities:**
    * **Relic of Knowledge (Lamp):** Carried by Ozpin. Can answer three questions every one hundred years.
    * **Relic of Creation (Staff):** Located in Atlas. Can create anything its wielder can imagine, provided they have enough Aura.
    * **Relic of Destruction (Sword):** Located in Vacuo. Its exact power is not fully known but is implied to be capable of immense destructive force.
    * **Relic of Choice (Crown):** Located in Mistral. Its exact power is not fully known but is implied to allow the wielder to see possible futures or make profound choices.
* **Guardianship:** Each Relic is guarded by one of the Maidens' powers, requiring the relevant Maiden to open its vault.
* **Role in Narrative:** Salem seeks to collect all four Relics to summon the Gods of Light and Darkness, hoping they will destroy humanity.

## Grimm
* **Description:** Creatures of darkness, born from pools of concentrated negativity and despair. They are drawn to negative emotions (fear, anger, sadness) and seek to destroy humanity and all life.
* **Appearance:** Vary widely, from animalistic forms (Beowolves, Ursas) to more monstrous and intelligent forms (Goliaths, Nuckelavee, Monstra). They are typically black with white bone-like plating and red eyes.
* **Reproduction/Growth:** They are born from Grimm pools or by accumulating negative emotions. Older Grimm are often larger, more powerful, and more intelligent.
* **Weaknesses:** They have no Aura, cannot regenerate like humans or Faunus, and are vulnerable to Silver Eyes. They are also drawn to negative emotions, which can be exploited.
* **Evolution:** Some Grimm can evolve into more dangerous forms over time, especially if exposed to significant negative emotions.
* **Role in Narrative:** The primary monstrous antagonists of Remnant, a constant threat to humanity, and a tool used by Salem to fulfill her destructive goals.
