**[Begin Section 47-A]**

**(Use the full text from Chapter 46 as the preceding context.)**

The perspective shifts to a different section of the battle. While Cinder was making her play for the Relic, Tyrian has been dutifully carrying out his orders: to create maximum terror and chaos. This section establishes him in his element. He's a whirlwind of manic laughter and deadly strikes, toying with a group of Vacuan defenders and some of our heroes, specifically pinning down Lie Ren's team with his terrifying speed and poison. He is not trying to achieve a strategic objective; he is reveling in the violence.

**Crucial Ending Point:** Tyrian has Ren and the others on the defensive, his laughter echoing as he prepares to finish them off.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**(Use the full text from Section 47-A as the preceding context.)**

A familiar figure drops from the sky, blocking Tyrian's path: Qrow Branwen. This section is their immediate, violent confrontation. There is no preamble. The fight should be fast and personal, a clash of their long history. Qrow is grim, determined, and fighting with the fury of someone protecting his family. Tyrian is ecstatic, overjoyed to have his "rival" join the party. Their dialogue during the fight should be sharp and cutting, referencing their past encounters.

This section is about Taiyang entering the fray. He's not just there for his daughters; he's there to protect his family, which includes Qrow. The fight's dynamic immediately shifts. Tyrian, for the first time, loses his smile, faced with the combined force of two of Remnant's most experienced Huntsmen.

This section showcases the combined might of the three heroes. Their fighting styles are very different, but they work together to counter Tyrian's frenzied attacks. Describe their synergy: Taiyang's grounded, powerful brawling acts as the anchor, forcing Tyrian into defensive positions. Qrow uses his sweeping scythe attacks to control the space. Ren, now recovered, uses his speed and precision to attack Tyrian's blind spots and create openings. They methodically break down Tyrian's frantic defense, forcing him into a corner.

This is the final, brutal end of Tyrian Callows. With Tyrian staggered, Taiyang seizes the opportunity. He unleashes a devastating flurry of powerful blows that batters Tyrian and pins him in place. This creates the final opening for Qrow to deliver a single, definitive, and fatal strike. Tyrian's defeat should be absolute. His final words should be a gasp of praise for his "Goddess" Salem, showing his unwavering devotion even in death.

**Crucial Ending Point:** This is the end of Chapter 47. Tyrian lies defeated. Taiyang, Qrow, and Ren stand over him, exhausted but victorious, having eliminated one of Salem's most dangerous agents.
