### **Prompt 35-A: A Global Strategy**

**Objective:** The newly formed "war council" of veterans and the younger leaders decide they must try to contact the rest of the world, devising a plan to briefly reactivate a global communication system.

**[Begin Section 35-A]**

**(Use the full text from Chapter 34 as the preceding context.)**

The chapter opens in the main command center with the full leadership alliance. The discussion, led by the "elder statesmen" like Glynda and Qrow, centers on a new problem: isolation. They have no idea what's happening in the rest of Remnant. This section focuses on their decision to attempt a "call to arms." They devise a high-risk, high-energy plan to use salvaged Atlas technology combined with local resources to get the Amity Tower system (or a similar network) operational for one, single, powerful broadcast to the entire planet.

**Crucial Ending Point:** The plan is set. The technical experts like Weiss get to work, and the leaders begin to draft their crucial message.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** Glynda Goodwitch and Weiss are working together over a piece of complex, glowing communications technology salvaged from Atlas. Glynda is using her Semblance to hold delicate parts in place while Weiss carefully makes adjustments.

### **Prompt 35-B: The Message to Remnant**

**Objective:** Ruby, as the voice of the new unified front, broadcasts a powerful message of hope and defiance to any survivors across the globe.

**[Begin Section 35-B]**

**(Use the full text from Section 35-A as the preceding context.)**

The system is ready. It's time to broadcast. This section is dedicated to Ruby's speech. She sits before a microphone, the weight of the world on her shoulders. Her message is not just a military call to arms; it's a deeply personal and hopeful plea. She speaks of loss, of fear, but also of unity, of the fight in Vacuo, and of the fact that no one is alone. Her voice, filled with her unwavering hope, is sent out across the globe, a single light in the darkness.

**Crucial Ending Point:** Ruby finishes her speech with a simple, powerful declaration: "We're still here. And we're not giving up." The broadcast ends, leaving the command center in a hopeful, reverent silence.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** A close-up on Ruby's face as she speaks into a microphone, her expression filled with earnest hope and fierce determination. In the background, a large holographic screen shows a map of Remnant with her signal broadcasting outwards from Vacuo.

**[End Section 35-B]**

### **Prompt 35-C: The Uninvited Guest**

**Objective:** Immediately following the broadcast, Raven Branwen makes a dramatic and unexpected entrance, appearing via portal in the middle of the command center.

**[Begin Section 35-C]**

**(Use the full text from Sections 35-A and 35-B as the preceding context.)**

The hopeful silence is shattered. A swirling red-and-black portal tears open in the middle of the room. This section is all about the shock and tension of Raven Branwen's arrival. She steps through, confident and imposing. The reaction is immediate and hostile. Yang and Qrow are instantly enraged, their weapons appearing in their hands. The other heroes react with shock and defensive postures. Raven, however, seems utterly unconcerned by their anger, her gaze sweeping the room with cold, analytical appraisal.

**Crucial Ending Point:** Raven meets Yang's furious glare with a completely impassive expression. "Your speech was touching," she says, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "But hope is not a strategy."

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** Raven Branwen is stepping through a swirling red and black portal directly into the command tent. The heroes (Yang, Qrow, Ruby) are reacting with shock, drawing their weapons in a chaotic, defensive posture.

**[End Section 35-C]**

### **Prompt 35-D: The Gambit**

**Objective:** Raven dismisses their efforts and proposes her own dangerous, high-risk, high-reward gambit: a surgical strike on a key enemy target that she has located.

**[Begin Section 35-D]**

**(Use the full text from Sections 35-A, 35-B, and 35-C as the preceding context.)**

Ignoring the weapons pointed at her, Raven addresses the council. This section is her pitch. She tells them that rallying scattered survivors is a waste of time. To give their "hope" any meaning, they need a real, decisive victory. She then reveals her gambit. Using her unique knowledge and methods, she has located a critical, hidden targetâ€”perhaps a nexus where Salem is breeding her new Grimm, or the secret command post of a key lieutenant. She lays out a plan for a surgical strike, a dangerous but potentially game-changing operation.

**Crucial Ending Point:** Raven finishes her proposal, then tosses a datachip or an ancient scroll onto the tactical map. "There's the intelligence. If you have the courage to use it." The offer hangs in the air.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** Raven, with a cold, confident expression, tosses a datachip onto the tactical map in the center of the room. The stunned faces of Ruby and Jaune are reflected on the table's surface.

**[End Section 35-D]**

### **Prompt 35-E: The Devil's Bargain**

**Objective:** The chapter concludes with the alliance left to debate Raven's proposal, a "devil's bargain" that pits a potentially game-changing opportunity against the immense risk of trusting her.

**[Begin Section 35-E]**

**(Use the full text from Sections 35-A, 35-B, 35-C, and 35-D as the preceding context.)**

Raven may stay to watch their debate or leave them to it. This final section is about the intense, unresolved dilemma she has created. The alliance is split. The plan she proposed is brilliant, a high-reward gambit that could shift the momentum of the war. But it comes from their most untrustworthy source. Is it a trap? A manipulation? Can they afford to trust her? More critically, with the state of the world as it is, can they afford *not* to? The chapter ends with the heroes facing this impossible choice.

**Crucial Ending Point:** This is the end of Chapter 35. The alliance is left in a tense, unresolved debate, forced to consider a deal with the devil.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** Raven Branwen, fierce and imposing in her Maiden form, is addressing the assembled heroes in their command tent. A holographic map of Remnant glows behind her, and her expression conveys the dangerous, game-changing nature of her plan.

**[End Section 35-E]**
