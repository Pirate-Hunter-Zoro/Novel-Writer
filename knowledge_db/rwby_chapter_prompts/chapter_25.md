### **Prompt 25-A: A New Drive**

**Objective:** The heroes begin to process their grief from the revelation about Summer Rose, re-framing her death not as a simple tragedy, but as an unfinished mission that they now must complete.

**[Begin Section 25-A]**

**(Use the full text from Chapter 24 as the preceding context.)**

The chapter opens a day or two after the events of Chapter 24. The raw, explosive grief has settled into a cold, hard determination. This section is about a crucial shift in perspective, likely initiated by Ruby or Taiyang. They realize Summer didn't just die; she found a vital secret about Salem, something important enough to be targeted by a unique, ancient Grimm. Her final mission wasn't a failure to be mourned, but an unfinished victory to be claimed. This re-frames their motivation from personal grief to strategic necessity. They must finish what Summer started.

**Crucial Ending Point:** Ruby, holding Summer's recovered scroll, looks at her team with a new fire in her eyes. "We know why she did it. Now we have to finish it."

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** Ruby is holding Summer's battered scroll in her hands. Her expression is no longer just sad, but fiercely determined, a spark of her mother's legendary resolve now visible in her silver eyes.

### **Prompt 25-B: The Right Question**

**Objective:** Realizing their intersecting problems—finding the Summer Maiden and confronting Raven—might be linked, the team decides to use one of their last questions for the Relic of Knowledge.

**[Begin Section 25-B]**

**(Use the full text from Section 25-A as the preceding context.)**

The team convenes a council of their core allies. They lay out their two biggest problems: they need to find the Summer Maiden to access the Relic of Destruction (from Chapter 18), and they need to find Raven for a personal reckoning and for the information she may have (from Chapter 24). This section focuses on the intense debate as they realize these two problems might be the *same problem*. They decide they must use one of their last questions for Jinn. The drama comes from them carefully workshopping the exact, perfect phrasing of the question to get the most useful information possible without wasting it.

**Crucial Ending Point:** They have agreed upon a single, carefully-worded question that connects Raven Branwen to the Summer Maiden. Oscar prepares to summon Jinn.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** The core team is gathered around a table. Jaune is pointing at a small whiteboard with two questions written on it: "Where is the Summer Maiden?" and "Where is Raven Branwen?", with a large, hand-drawn question mark connecting the two.

**[End Section 25-B]**

### **Prompt 25-C: Consulting the Oracle**

**Objective:** Oscar summons Jinn, and the team asks their carefully formulated question, creating a moment of tense, magical reverence.

**[Begin Section 25-C]**

**(Use the full text from Sections 25-A and 25-B as the preceding context.)**

This section is the ritual. The team clears the room, the atmosphere becoming tense and quiet. Oscar takes out the Relic of Knowledge. Describe the light, the sound, and the feeling of immense, ancient power as he rubs the lamp. The ethereal, blue form of Jinn materializes before them. The focus should be on the weight of the moment; they only have one question left after this. Oscar, as the designated speaker, looks at his friends for a final nod of confirmation, then turns to Jinn and asks their question: "Jinn, what can you tell us about the connection between Raven Branwen and the current Summer Maiden?"

**Crucial Ending Point:** Jinn's eyes open wide, and she smiles a knowing, cryptic smile. "An interesting question," she says, her voice echoing as she prepares to show them the answer.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** Oscar is holding the glowing Relic of Knowledge aloft in the dim room. The massive, blue, ethereal form of Jinn is materializing above him, her eyes opening as she fills the space with light.

**[End Section 25-C]**

### **Prompt 25-D: The Oracle's Hint**

**Objective:** Jinn provides a cryptic but crucial answer, likely in the form of a vision, that confirms a link between Raven and the Summer Maiden and gives a clue to the Maiden's nature.

**[Begin Section 25-D]**

**(Use the full text from Sections 25-A, 25-B, and 25-C as the preceding context.)**

This section is the answer. Jinn doesn't give a name or a map. She shows them a vision. The vision could be of Raven, cloaked and anonymous, observing a nomadic-looking woman in the desert from a great distance. As the woman walks, the barren sand around her feet momentarily sprouts with vibrant, impossible life—a clear sign of the Summer Maiden's subconscious power. Jinn might add a cryptic sentence to the vision, something like, "The one who runs from family seeks the one who has none. The cycle of seasons cannot be broken." The vision is brief but packed with clues: Raven is searching for her, and the Summer Maiden appears to be a wanderer, alone in the desert.

**Crucial Ending Point:** The vision abruptly ends, and Jinn vanishes, leaving the team in stunned silence to process the cryptic but vital information they just received.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** The glowing Relic of Knowledge (Jinn's Lamp) is floating between Ozpin (a ghostly outline) and Oscar, who are looking with intense focus at an ethereal vision projected before them, showing a new, vital strategic clue.

**[End Section 25-D]**

### **Prompt 25-E: The New Path**

**Objective:** The chapter concludes with the team deciphering Jinn's clue, realizing they are now in a race with Raven to find the Summer Maiden, and mobilizing for their new hunt.

**[Begin Section 25-E]**

**(Use the full text from Sections 25-A, 25-B, 25-C, and 25-D as the preceding context.)**

The final section is about turning the cryptic clue into an actionable plan. The team quickly deciphers the vision. They now know what the Summer Maiden looks like and her likely nature as a nomad. Most importantly, they know Raven is also looking for her. Their family reckoning has just become a high-stakes race. Their new path is clear. They must use the clues from the vision to find the Summer Maiden before Raven does. The chapter ends with the alliance's resources being mobilized for this new, urgent hunt.

**Crucial Ending Point:** This is the end of Chapter 25. The team has a clear, if difficult, new mission, and the hunt for the Summer Maiden has officially begun.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** A shot of the tactical map of Vacuo again, but now Qrow is drawing a large circle around a vast, largely uninhabited region known for its nomadic tribes, indicating the starting point of their new, urgent search.

**[End Section 25-E]**
