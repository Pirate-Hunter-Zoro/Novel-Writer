The chapter opens with the team returning to the settlement, sobered by their fight with the new Grimm. Upon their return, they receive unexpected news.

This section must focus on Blake's reaction—stunned disbelief turning into a desperate, overwhelming hope. The team's mission is no longer about abstract strategy; it's now deeply personal.

In turn, Ghira and Kali share their own harrowing story of escaping the chaos, gathering their people, and establishing this hub. They give an update on the status of Menagerie and the Faunus who managed to flee to Vacuo. The mood is one of profound relief, but also deep sorrow for all that was lost.
