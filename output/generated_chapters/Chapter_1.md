# Chapter 1

Chapter 1: Dust and Desert

Ruby’s first sensation was weight. A crushing, unfamiliar weight pressing down on her, pinning her to… something.  Something gritty, hot, and unforgiving. Her eyelids felt fused shut, crusted with… sand?  A low, guttural groan escaped her, more a reflex than a conscious sound.  The world swam back in fragmented pieces: shimmering heat haze, a deafening roar that resolved into wind, the taste of dust coating her tongue like a bitter film.

*Remnant… Vacuo… We’re back.* The thought flickered, distant and fragile, a butterfly struggling to break free from a chrysalis of confusion.  Ruby’s hand twitched, flexing against the coarse, burning sand. The familiar weight of Crescent Rose was absent.  Panic flared, a spark in the haze.  “Crescent…?” she rasped, the word catching in her dry throat.

Weiss’s world snapped into focus with the jarring suddenness of shattered glass. One moment, ethereal nothingness; the next, searing heat and a disorienting sense of *down*.  She gasped, choking on the gritty air, her lungs burning.  Her vision swam, blurred by dust and the shimmering mirage of the desert landscape. *Vacuo.*  The name surfaced, a cold shard of recognition amidst the chaos.  Her hand instinctively flew to Myrtenaster, finding only the rough texture of sand.  “Where…?” she began, her voice a strained whisper, before a wave of nausea forced her to swallow the rest of the word. The desert spun, the horizon tilting precariously.  With a concentrated effort, Weiss steadied herself, drawing on ingrained Schnee discipline to fight back the disorientation. She *would not* succumb to this… this primal assault on her senses.  She scanned their surroundings, her eyes narrowed against the glare, seeking something, *anything*, familiar or stable.

Blake landed with a cat’s grace, her Faunus senses immediately assaulted by the raw, untamed energy of the Vacuan desert.  The searing heat radiated through her, baking her skin.  The air, thick with dust, carried the faint, metallic tang of recent conflict and the distant ozone scent of Grimm. The gritty sand shifted beneath her, a stark contrast to the ethereal nothingness of the Ever After. Her hand instinctively went to Gambol Shroud, the familiar weight grounding her in the chaotic present.  She took a shallow breath, forcing calmness, her eyes already scanning the desolate landscape. Every rustle of the wind, every distant shadow, held the potential for danger. The Ever After had changed them, yes, but the instincts honed over years of fighting for survival remained sharp. Blake stood, a silent sentinel, her senses on high alert.

Yang slammed into the sand, a jarring impact that sent a tremor through her prosthetic arm.  Frustration, raw and immediate, flared within her.  The Ever After… that *dream*… had messed with her, left her feeling… off.  The weight of her own body felt wrong, the connection to her prosthetic arm tenuous.  She pushed herself up, gritting her teeth against a phantom ache in her missing limb.  The heat beat down on her, the sand clinging to her skin like a second, unwelcome layer. “Ugh,” she grunted, wiping the dust from her eyes with the back of her hand.  “What the hell kind of landing was that?”  Her gaze swept the desolate landscape, seeking her teammates, a protective instinct overriding the disorientation. Where were they? Were they alright? 

Jaune landed heavily, the impact jarring him back to a reality he hadn’t fully processed yet.  Decades in the Ever After – decades that felt like a lifetime, a different lifetime – had left their mark. Though his youthful appearance had returned, the weight of those years pressed down on him, an invisible burden. He rose slowly, his movements deliberate, a newfound stillness in his posture. The gritty sand of Vacuo, the burning sun, the dry, rasping wind – it was all… overwhelmingly real. A stark contrast to the mutable, dreamlike world he'd left behind.  He took a slow, deep breath, the dry air catching in his throat.  His hand instinctively went to his hip, finding Crocea Mors, the familiar weight a small anchor in the sea of his disorientation. He looked around, his eyes searching for his teammates, his face a mask of calm that hid the tumultuous emotions churning within.

Ruby blinked, her vision slowly clearing.  She saw Weiss, a few feet away, still pale but regaining her composure.  Blake stood a little further out, her back to them, her posture taut, scanning the horizon.  And Yang… Yang was pushing herself up, her face contorted in frustration.  Relief washed over Ruby, a fragile wave against the tide of disorientation.  “We’re… we’re back,” she murmured, the words sounding strange and small in the vast emptiness of the desert.

Weiss, having regained a semblance of control, straightened her dust-covered skirt.  "Indeed," she replied, her voice still strained, "though I confess I find this method of return… less than ideal.”  Her gaze swept the desolate landscape, taking in the broken, sand-blasted structures in the distance. "Vacuo. Just as… as it was foreseen."

Blake turned, her eyes meeting Ruby’s. A flicker of something – relief? Concern? – crossed her usually stoic features.  “Are you alright, Rubes?” she asked, her voice low.  The concern in her voice reached Ruby like a lifeline.

“Yeah,” Ruby managed, her voice cracking slightly. “Just… a bit dizzy.” She glanced around, still struggling to process the sudden shift.  “Where’s Jaune?”

Yang finally stood, her jaw clenched.  “Damn Ever After,” she muttered, flexing her prosthetic fingers. “Feels like I haven’t used these things in years.” She glanced at Blake, her expression softening slightly. “You okay, Blake?”

“I’m… adjusting,” Blake replied, her gaze returning to the horizon.  “This place… it feels… raw.”

Jaune approached, his footsteps silent in the sand.  “It’s… good to see you all,” he said, his voice quiet but steady.  There was a new depth to his eyes, a weight that hadn’t been there before.

Ruby’s eyes widened slightly.  Something was different about Jaune.  Older, somehow…  But it wasn’t just his appearance.  It was something in his bearing, a quiet confidence that she hadn’t seen before.  “Jaune… you…”  She trailed off, unsure how to articulate the shift she sensed.

Jaune gave a small, almost rueful smile. "It's a long story," he said.

A sudden gust of wind whipped around them, sending a swirl of dust spiraling into the air.  Weiss shielded her eyes, her expression hardening.  “This place… it feels… wrong,” she said, her voice laced with a hint of unease.  “There’s a… a tension in the air.”

Blake nodded, her Faunus ears twitching.  “I sense it too,” she said, her gaze fixed on the horizon. “Something… unsettling.”  She pointed towards a faint plume of smoke rising in the distance. “There.”

Yang followed her gaze, her eyes narrowing.  “Smoke… that means…”

“Fire,” Ruby finished, her voice barely a whisper.  “And where there’s fire…”  Her hand finally went to her hip, and this time, she found Crescent Rose.  The familiar weight settled against her, a comforting presence in the unsettling landscape. “...there’s usually Grimm.”

The vastness of the Vacuan desert stretched before them, a desolate expanse of sand and shattered remnants of what might have once been civilization. Broken structures, half-buried by the shifting dunes, stood like skeletal fingers against the burning sky. The wind howled, a mournful cry echoing across the desolate landscape. The air shimmered with heat, distorting the distant horizon.  The faint plume of smoke, now joined by another, hung like a dark omen in the otherwise clear sky.  They were back on Remnant.  But the world they had returned to was not the world they had left.

Ruby took a deep breath, the dust-laden air scratching at her lungs.  “We need to find shelter,” she said, her voice gaining a new firmness.  “And figure out what’s going on.”

Weiss nodded, her gaze still fixed on the distant smoke plumes. “Agreed.  And soon.”  The wind whipped her white hair around her face, a stark contrast to the swirling red dust.

Blake adjusted her grip on Gambol Shroud.  “Let’s move,” she said, her voice quiet but decisive.

Yang cracked her knuckles, the sound sharp in the dry air. “Lead the way, Rubes.”

Jaune, his hand resting on Crocea Mors, met Ruby’s gaze.  “We’ll figure this out,” he said, his voice calm and reassuring. “Together.”

Ruby nodded, a new sense of resolve hardening her gaze.  The Ever After had changed them, tested them, broken them… but it had also forged something new within them. A strength, a resilience, a fierce determination to protect the world they had fought so hard to return to.  She took a step forward, the sand shifting beneath her boots.  The journey had just begun.  And they would face it, together.
