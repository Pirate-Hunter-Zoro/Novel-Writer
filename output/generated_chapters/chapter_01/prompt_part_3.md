### **Prompt 1-C: The Wreckage**

**Objective:** Continuing *immediately* from the discovery, this part covers their cautious approach to and detailed investigation of the *exterior* of the wrecked transport skiff.

**[Begin Section 1-C]**

**(Use the full text from Sections 1-A and 1-B as the preceding context.)**

With a shared target now identified, the team begins a cautious, tactical approach across the dunes toward the source of the sound or glint. Describe their movement as a team, falling back into old, familiar formations.

This section is a deep, forensic investigation of the crash site. As they get closer, describe the wreckage in vivid detail: a Shade Academy transport skiff, half-buried in a sand dune. Detail the evidence of a recent, violent conflict.

* Show the deep scorch marks and massive, gouging claw gashes that are clearly from a Grimm attack.
* Describe the scattered cargo—crates of Dust (some cracked and leaking), medical supplies trampled into the sand, and discarded personal effects.
* Use the characters' skills: Weiss analyzes the damage, identifying the likely Grimm type. Blake examines the sand, trying to distinguish between human and Grimm tracks, looking for signs of survivors. Yang, meanwhile, acts as an aggressive sentinel, her eyes constantly scanning the horizon for returning threats.

**Crucial Ending Point:** The section ends as they stand before the breached cockpit door, having fully assessed the exterior damage. They have determined it was a Grimm attack, but they don't know the fate of the crew. The decision to look inside is made.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** A medium shot showing the team investigating the exterior of the half-buried skiff. Weiss is touching a large Grimm-claw gash on the hull with an analytical expression, while Blake is crouched nearby, examining tracks in the sand. Yang stands guard in the background, alert and watching their backs.
