The silence that followed their return was a fraud. It was a thin veneer stretched taut over a cacophony of howling wind and the frantic, ragged symphony of their own breathing. Here, in the heart of Vacuo’s desolation, the world was an anvil and the sun a hammer, beating down with a relentless, percussive force that baked the very air until it shimmered like troubled water.

Jaune felt the whiplash of his own existence in every straining breath. For what felt like a lifetime, he had been the Rusted Knight, his movements encased in the groaning protest of ancient metal, his world viewed through a slit of corroded steel. His joints had carried the deep, sonorous ache of decades. Now, gravity was a shocking reclamation. He felt the pull of the world on muscles that were impossibly, unnervingly young. A phantom ache for joints he no longer possessed ghosted through his limbs, a bewildering echo of a man he was and wasn't. He lifted a hand, flexing fingers that were lean and unscarred, and felt the alien lightness of his own skull without the crushing weight of his helmet.

He looked up, not at the sky, but at the sun. It was a judgment, a white-hot crucible suspended in a pitiless sapphire expanse, and its light was a physical blade against the eyes. He squinted, the motion pulling at skin that felt too tight, too smooth. “The sun is past its zenith,” he said, his voice a raw rasp against the wind’s scouring howl. It wasn’t the pronouncement of a leader, but the simple, weary observation of a man who had learned to read the sky as his only clock for far too long. “If we stay here, we’re just waiting to be buried or baked.”

His gaze fell on the others, each trapped in their own private crucible.

Weiss was a study in rigid misery. In the Ever After, her body had been a construct, a tiny, determined doll of carved wood and painted porcelain. Here, physicality had returned with a vengeance. Gravity felt like a personal affront, a coarse hand pressing her down into the granular torment of the sand. A fine, gritty film coated her tongue, her skin, the inside of her pristine white coat, which was already looking like a fool’s choice. Sweat, a sensation she had almost forgotten, traced icy, unwelcome paths down her spine. Every muscle, once remembering the effortless grace of a fencer or the porcelain brittleness of her smaller form, now screamed with the unfamiliar strain of simply existing against this oppressive heat. She felt heavy, clumsy, a creature of ice and precision thrust into a forge’s breath. *This is real,* a part of her mind chanted, a mantra of disbelief and despair. *This is not a story. The aches are real. The thirst is real.*

Beside her, Blake was trying to shrink into herself. The wind, for the others a source of noise and grit, was for her a direct assault. It was a sibilant whisper and a banshee’s lament funneled directly into her sensitive ears, each gust a fresh wave of static and sand that made her want to claw them off. The blinding glare had rendered her Faunus night vision utterly useless, replacing it with a throbbing headache centered behind her eyes. She could feel every grain of sand that had worked its way under her collar, into her boots, a thousand tiny points of irritation. She shifted, and the familiar, grinding complaint in her lumbar from the weight of Gambol Shroud was almost a comfort—a known pain in a world of overwhelming, hostile sensation. She had spent so long running from herself, from her past. In the Ever After, she’d been forced to confront that. Now, the path wasn't behind or away; it was simply *forward*, into this furnace. And it was terrifying.

Then there was Yang. She stood with her feet planted wide, a defiant silhouette against the shimmering horizon. For her, the heat was a tangible enemy, something to be met with a stubborn glare and clenched fists. But it was a battle she was losing. Her cybernetic arm, a marvel of Atlesian engineering, had become a brand. The metal, exposed to the direct solar onslaught, was a conduit of pure heat, radiating a searing warmth through its socket into the very bone of her shoulder. She consciously kept it away from her body, the air around it visibly wavering. Phantom pangs from an arm long since turned to dust mingled with the memory of its brief, fleshy return in the fairy-tale world. She was the team’s engine, its forward momentum, but even she felt her energy being leached away, drawn out of her by the merciless sun. Her gaze flickered to Ruby, and the fire in her eyes banked into a smoldering, protective concern.

Ruby herself was the quietest of all. She stood slightly apart, Crescent Rose planted in the sand beside her like a grim, metal shepherd’s crook. For her, the return to Remnant felt less like a homecoming and more like an eviction. In the moments after ascending, her body had felt ethereal, light, almost disconnected. Now, reality was crashing back in. Her bones felt hollow, like a bird’s, and gravity was a thief, stealing the very air from her lungs before she could draw it in. The light was too much, the noise of the wind too loud; it was all a sensory overload that left her feeling detached, watching the scene through a haze of heat and exhaustion. The metallic scent of her scythe, the familiar heft of its grip in her hand—these were the only anchors tethering her to this blistering present. *I led them here,* the insidious thought whispered, a chilling counterpoint to the hot wind. *I led them to the fall. Now… what?* She looked at Jaune, then at Weiss and Blake and her sister, seeing not just her team, but the totality of her responsibility manifest as four figures slowly being worn down by the elements.

Jaune pushed himself to his feet. The motion was graceless, a struggle in the deep, yielding sand. The metal plates of his armor, once a source of comfort and identity, now felt like an oven. He scanned the horizon, a slow, methodical sweep learned from endless, lonely patrols. His eyes, accustomed to the muted colors of the Ever After, squinted against the glare until he found it.

“There,” he said, pointing. His voice was stronger now, imbued with a sliver of purpose.

They followed his outstretched arm. In the distance, distorted by the atmospheric shimmer, was a darker line against the endless ochre and gold—a spine of rock, a low-lying mesa. It wasn’t salvation, but it was something other than sand. It was a feature. A destination.

“Rock formations,” Jaune elaborated, his strategic mind, honed by solitary decades, clicking back into place. “They can mean shelter from the wind. Shade. And where there’s shade and rock, there’s a chance of condensation. Maybe even a spring.”

It was the first tendril of hope any of them had felt since they’d opened their eyes in this wasteland.

Yang was the first to react, moving to Ruby’s side and gripping her shoulder. The warmth from her flesh-and-blood hand was a stark contrast to the radiating heat of her prosthetic. “You heard the man, sis. One foot in front of the other.”

Ruby looked at her sister’s face, then at the determined set of Jaune’s jaw, the weary resolve in Weiss’s eyes, the quiet nod from Blake. She felt a fractional shift inside her, the brittle hollowness gaining an ounce of substance. She wasn’t leading them now. They were moving together.

With a collective groan of strained muscles and protesting leather, they hefted their weapons. The weight of them was immense, a physical manifestation of the burdens they all carried. Ruby folded Crescent Rose into its compact form, the metallic clicks sharp and final in the wind. Blake secured Gambol Shroud. Weiss straightened her back, a queen reclaiming her posture even in hell.

Jaune took the first step, then another, his boots sinking into the sand, setting a slow, deliberate pace. Yang and Blake fell in on either side of Ruby, a human shield against the elements. Weiss brought up the rear, her eyes scanning their back trail for a moment before turning resolutely forward.

The crashed shell of the transport they’d arrived in was already receding behind them, a monument to their impossible journey. Ahead lay only the shimmering, hostile beauty of the desert. They walked, and for the first time since falling, they were not just surviving. They were returning.
