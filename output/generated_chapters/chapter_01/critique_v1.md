    * **Result:** Quality Pacing Failure.
    * **Details:** While the initial descriptions of the characters' return and their individual reactions are detailed and immersive, the narrative shifts to a more action-oriented and summary-based style during the "Central Mini-Event." The investigation of the skiff lacks the same level of sensory detail and internal monologue as the opening sections. For example, the prompt explicitly asked for details like the specific types of scorch marks and the age of the attack to be analyzed by Weiss, yet these are glossed over with generic descriptions like "scorch marks marred the sand" and "deep claw gashes."  The discovery of the datapad also lacks the "excruciating detail" demanded by the prompt. The content of the video message is vaguely described, and the characters' reactions to this chilling discovery are not explored with sufficient depth.
