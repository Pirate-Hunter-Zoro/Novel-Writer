**[Begin Section 1-C]**

Hope, fragile as a desert flower, bloomed in the desolation.  The distant silhouette solidified as they approached, resolving into the battered, sand-blasted form of a Shade Academy transport skiff, half-swallowed by a towering dune.  Instinct took over, years of training reasserting themselves as they fell into a familiar diamond formation.  Ruby at the point, her Crescent Rose still slung across her back, her senses hyper-alert.  Blake and Weiss flanking her, their movements mirroring each other in a silent dance of shared purpose. Yang brought up the rear, her fists clenched, a simmering protectiveness radiating from her. Jaune, his hand resting on the hilt of Crocea Mors, moved in the center, his gaze sweeping the landscape with a newfound vigilance.

The air grew heavy with the metallic tang of blood, mingling with the pervasive scent of ozone. As they drew closer, the grim reality of the scene became horrifyingly clear.  Deep scorch marks marred the skiff's hull, like blackened claw marks against the pale metal.  Massive gashes, some nearly a meter long, ripped through the armor plating, revealing twisted metal and sparking wires beneath.  These were no ordinary scratches; they were the unmistakable signature of a Grimm attack, likely a large, powerful creature judging by the sheer force required to inflict such damage.

Weiss knelt by one of the gouges, her fingers tracing the edges of the torn metal.  "Manticore," she murmured, her voice tight with suppressed emotion.  "Judging by the width and depth of the claw marks… possibly multiple."  She closed her eyes for a moment, the image of the creature flashing through her mind – its massive, leathery wings, its razor-sharp talons, its piercing shriek.  She pushed the thought away, forcing herself to focus on the task at hand.  "Recent, too," she added, her voice regaining its professional tone.  "The metal is still hot to the touch."

Blake crouched low to the ground, her Faunus ears twitching, picking up the faintest sounds.  The sand around the skiff was a chaotic tapestry of tracks – deep, clawed impressions interwoven with the smaller, more erratic prints of human boots.  She followed the human tracks, her eyes scanning for any sign of survivors.  A discarded canteen, half-buried in the sand.  A torn piece of fabric, stained dark with… something.  Her stomach churned.  She closed her eyes briefly, inhaling deeply, trying to discern any lingering scents.  Ozone… blood… and the faint, acrid smell of fear.

Yang prowled the perimeter, her gaze constantly scanning the horizon, her semblance flickering beneath the surface like a caged beast.  The vastness of the desert, the oppressive silence broken only by the howl of the wind, grated on her nerves.  Every shadow, every shifting dune, seemed to hold a potential threat.  Her muscles were coiled tight, ready to spring into action at the slightest provocation. The Ever After… it had left her feeling raw, exposed.  The protective instinct, always simmering beneath the surface, burned with a fiercer intensity now.

Jaune, his grief a silent weight in his chest, moved with a quiet determination. He found himself picking up a discarded first aid kit, its contents spilled across the sand. Bandages, antiseptic wipes, a shattered vial of Dust.  He stared at it for a long moment, the mundane objects suddenly imbued with a profound sense of loss.  He carefully gathered the scattered supplies, placing them back in the damaged kit.  It was a small gesture, a futile attempt to restore some semblance of order in this chaotic landscape. But it was something.  A tangible action in the face of overwhelming despair.

They converged at the cockpit door, its metal frame twisted and bent, a gaping hole where it had once been sealed. The interior was shrouded in shadow, the fate of the crew unknown.  A shared look passed between them, a silent acknowledgment of the grim task ahead.  Ruby took a deep breath, her hand tightening on Crescent Rose's grip.  “Okay,” she said, her voice echoing the resolve that had taken root within her.  “Let’s see what’s inside.”

### **Prompt 1-D: The Cockpit and the Climax**

**Objective:** Continuing *immediately* from the end of the previous section, this part focuses on the tense investigation of the skiff's interior, leading to the chapter's central, chilling discovery.

**[Begin Section 1-D]**

**(Use the full text from Sections 1-A, 1-B, and 1-C as the preceding context.)**

The team breaches the cockpit. The atmosphere inside should be tense and claustrophobic, a stark contrast to the open desert. Describe the signs of a desperate, final struggle within the confined space—dents in the console, a discarded weapon, maybe a tear in a seat.

This entire section builds to the chapter's mini-climax. After a few moments of searching, they find something that makes the abstract threat of their return horrifyingly real and immediate.

* **Path A (The Datapad):** Tucked under a seat or still clutched in a dislodged pilot's gauntlet, they find a datapad. Its screen is cracked but still functional. It displays a single, chilling, unfinished emergency transmission: "They're here... Sky is falling... Grimm are not... not like before... request immedi—" The message cuts out.
* **Path B (The Grimm):** A noise from a shadowed corner of the cockpit reveals a single, grievously wounded Beowolf, trapped and dying from the crash. It is mangled and pathetic, but still dangerous. It langes one last time, forcing a swift, brutal, and personal execution that solidifies their return to war.

**Crucial Ending Point:** This section must end at the absolute peak of the climax: the moment they read the final word of the message and its implication sinks in, OR the moment the final deathblow is dealt to the wounded Grimm.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** A tight, claustrophobic shot from inside the dark cockpit. The only light comes from a cracked datapad screen held by Jaune, illuminating his and Ruby's horrified faces as they read the ominous, unfinished message.
