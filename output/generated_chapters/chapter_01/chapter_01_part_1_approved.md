The return was not a gentle awakening. It was a cataclysm.

One moment, there was the saccharine, storybook unreality of the Ever After—a world of talking animals and existential flora. The next, there was only violence. A bone-shattering shriek of tearing metal, a concussive blast of displaced air, and then the overwhelming, omnidirectional assault of a world that had forgotten them.

For Weiss, the first sensation was weight. The weight was a betrayal, a crushing hand slamming her back into a reality she had almost forgotten, where bones were brittle things and flight was a memory stolen by the unforgiving pull of the world. As a bird, she had been air and instinct. Now, sprawled on her side, she was merely flesh and aching joints. A brutal anchor.

*Gravity,* her mind supplied, the thought a shard of ice in a furnace. *This is gravity.*

The heat followed, a physical blow that sucked the moisture from her lungs and turned the air to fire. It was nothing like the temperate climates of Atlas or the mild warmth of Vale. This was a hostile, living heat that pressed in from all sides, radiating from a sky the color of a bleached-out sapphire and from the ground beneath her—a shifting, abrasive sea of pale sand. The light was its accomplice, a white, vitreous glare so absolute it felt as though the sun had detonated inches from her face, burning away all color and shadow. She squeezed her eyes shut, but the intensity seared through her eyelids, painting the inside of her vision a throbbing, painful red.

*Assess. Survive. Logic.* The old Schnee training kicked in, a desperate mantra against the sensory cacophony. She forced one eye open a crack. The world swam in a haze of shimmering heat, the horizon a distorted, liquid mercury line. The air was thick with a fine, gritty dust that coated her tongue like powdered glass and stung her eyes. It was everywhere, a pale ghost clinging to her white jacket, already staining it a miserable beige. The irony was a bitter pill—the Schnee Dust Company heiress, brought low by common, useless dust.

A few yards away, a figure stirred. Black hair, a tattered yellow ribbon. Blake.

Blake’s return was a symphony of torment for her heightened senses. The howling wind was not just a sound; it was a physical scouring, a high-pitched scream that carried millions of tiny, sharp-edged particles of sand. It flayed the exposed skin of her face and hands, and the noise drilled into her sensitive Faunus ears, a dentist’s drill against raw nerve. She pressed her palms over them, but it was useless. The sound was inside her skull.

The heat was a predator. It beat down on her dark hair and clothing, a suffocating blanket woven from static and fire. She could feel the sun baking her skin, drawing the life out of her. In the Ever After, her form had been fluid, a reflection of need. Here, she was trapped in a body that felt alienly vulnerable. Her lungs burned with every breath of superheated air. The world smelled of baked rock, ozone, and a profound, desolate emptiness.

Her gaze found Yang, a splash of violent gold against the monochrome wasteland. Yang was on one knee, her prosthetic arm planted in the sand, knuckles down, as if to physically defy the planet’s attempt to swallow them. Concern, sharp and clear, cut through Blake’s own misery. *Yang. Is she…*

Yang felt the world as a challenge. The heat was a furnace, and she was the anvil. Every inch of her skin prickled, slick with a sweat that evaporated almost as soon as it formed, leaving a salty crust behind. Her lilac eyes, narrowed to slits against the glare, scanned their surroundings. Wreckage. Twisted, groaning metal—the remains of whatever vessel had ferried them here—formed a broken crescent around them. Beyond it, nothing. Dunes rolled into infinity, their crests whipped into fine plumes by the incessant wind.

Her prosthetic felt… solid. Heavier than she remembered. In the Ever After, it had been a part of her narrative, an extension of her will. Here, it was a complex machine of metal and circuits, its weight a familiar, grounding presence. She flexed the fingers, the whir of servos a small, reassuring sound against the wind’s shriek. The phantom ache in her shoulder, a ghost that had haunted her for years, was blessedly absent, replaced by the solid, definitive reality of the arm. She was whole. But the world was broken.

“Blake!” Her voice was a raw croak, torn from a throat lined with sand. She pushed to her feet, legs trembling with the effort. Each step was a battle, the sand sucking at her boots, trying to drag her down. She reached Blake, her shadow a meager patch of relief in the blinding sun. “You okay?”

Blake nodded, though the gesture was stiff, her face pale beneath its dusting of sand. “Overwhelmed,” she managed, her own voice barely a whisper. The simple act of speaking felt like swallowing hot coals.

Then Yang saw him. Jaune.

He was on his hands and knees, head bowed, his blond hair—no longer streaked with the grey of age—caked with dust. He wasn’t looking at the sky or the wreckage. He was staring at his own hands.

For Jaune Arc, the transition was the cruelest of miracles. One moment, he was the Rusted Knight, his body a roadmap of decades of sorrow and solitude, his joints a chorus of ossified aches. The next… the aches were gone. The deep-set lines on his face, the weariness that had settled into his very marrow—vanished. He was young again. The skin on his hands was smooth, the muscles in his arms coiled with a forgotten potency. But it felt wrong. It felt like a theft.

His mind was a maelstrom of temporal dissonance. The memories of his long, lonely years—the faces of the Paper Pleasers, the taste of rust and regret, the endless waiting—were still crystal clear, sharp-edged and painful. But they were housed in a body that had no right to them. He felt like a ghost haunting his own youth, a man out of time in his own skin. The weight of Crocea Mors, lying beside him, felt… light. Too light for the old man he had been. He ran a trembling hand over his face, expecting the familiar scrape of a beard, and met only smooth, strange skin. A wave of vertigo washed over him, so profound he thought he might vomit. *Who am I?* The question was not philosophical; it was a genuine, terrifying inquiry.

And then there was Ruby.

She hadn't moved. She lay on her back, one arm flung over her eyes, the other resting on the cool, unforgiving steel of Crescent Rose. She was a slash of red and black against the pale canvas of the desert, unnervingly still. The heat, the wind, the noise—they seemed to wash over her, not touching the core of her stillness.

Inside, however, she was drowning. The physical sensations were distant, muted echoes. The real assault was internal. The return to her own body was a brutal eviction from the strange peace she’d found in being… other. Being "just Ruby" again felt like putting on a suit of armor that was too tight, its edges digging into wounds she hadn't known were still there. The lightness she'd felt, the shedding of a burden she couldn't name, was gone. In its place was the crushing weight of leadership, of expectation, of her own monumental failures.

Her breath hitched, a ragged, painful sound. Her fingers tightened on her scythe. It was the only thing that felt real. Its familiar weight, the worn grip, the perfect balance—it was an anchor in the swirling chaos of her soul. *You chose this,* a voice whispered in her mind, the voice of the Blacksmith, of the tree, of herself. *You chose to be Ruby Rose.* But the choice, made in a world of metaphor, felt like a curse in this world of punishing reality. The heat on her skin was judgment. The sand in her throat was penance.

Slowly, shakily, Yang helped Blake to her feet. Weiss, her composure a fractured but functional shield, rose as well, her hand instinctively going to the hilt of Myrtenaster. Jaune pushed himself upright, his movements unsteady, like a fawn on new legs, his eyes lost and haunted.

One by one, they converged on the largest piece of wreckage—a skeletal metal ribcage that offered a sliver of shade. They huddled together, a small, battered island of humanity in a vast, indifferent ocean of sand. No one spoke. There were no words for this. There was only the howl of the wind, the sting of the sand, and the shared, ragged sound of their breathing, each gasp a fight against the hostile, alien air of Vacuo. They were back. They were together. And they were utterly, terrifyingly alone.
