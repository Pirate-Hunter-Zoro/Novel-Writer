### **Prompt 1-B: The Discovery**

**Objective:** Continuing *immediately* from the previous section, this part transitions the characters from static disorientation to active investigation, culminating in the discovery of the transport skiff.

**[Begin Section 1-B]**

**(Use the full text from Section 1-A as the preceding context.)**

With the initial shock wearing off and the reality of their situation setting in, the group begins to assess their surroundings more methodically. The immediate goal is survival and information. Jaune and Ruby should naturally begin to take the lead, directing the others to scan the horizon.

The focus of this section is their first, purposeful actions as a team. As they scan the seemingly empty desert, build tension through the environment. The wind howls, carrying with it faint, unsettling sounds. The heat haze plays tricks on their eyes.

The climax of this section is the discovery. It must not be obvious.

* **Path A:** Blake's Faunus hearing, now keenly attuned after the sensory deprivation of the Ever After, picks up the faint, rhythmic groan of stressed metal carried on the wind—a sound that does not belong in nature.
* **Path B:** Weiss, shielding her eyes and trying to analyze the terrain, spots a brief, unnatural glint of light through the shimmering air, a reflection off metal or glass where there should only be rock and sand.

**CRITICAL PACING DIRECTIVE: Maintain deep 'show, don't tell' detail throughout the scene. A brief, reflective summary is only permitted in the final paragraph.**
---

**Crucial Ending Point:** The section must end at the exact moment of discovery and their shared reaction to it—a new, sudden focus in the vast emptiness. They have a target.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** A shot from behind the team as they begin to spread out, scanning the horizon. Jaune is pointing into the distance. The focus is on the vast, empty desert before them, with Blake in the mid-ground, head tilted as if listening intently to something only she can hear.

**[End Section 1-B]**
