The universe did not welcome them back; it birthed them violently, an expulsion from impossible logic into a brutal axiom. There was no gentle transition. One moment, they were a concept tumbling through shifting, silent skies. The next, a furnace roared into existence, its voice a physical blow of scorching, desiccated air that stole the breath from their lungs.

For Ruby Rose, the world was first a color: white. An incandescent, merciless white that speared through her eyelids and burned away the memory-stain of the Ever After. Then came the sound, a high, thin scream of wind that felt like an attack. And then, gravity. It was a leaden blanket, a crushing physical truth that slammed into her, reminding her with excruciating certainty that she had a body again, a body of meat and bone and profound aches. She coughed, the sound a dry, pathetic rasp, and the grit of sand scraped against her teeth. Her silver eyes fluttered open to the blank shock of a system overwhelmed. The sun, a perfect, hateful sphere of white fire, was reflected in them. The weight of Crescent Rose on her back was suddenly an anchor, not a comfort, pulling her down into this hostile, solid world. *Home?* a thought flickered, a tiny spark in the blinding overload. *Is this… Remnant?*

“Ugh… Gods…” Weiss Schnee’s voice was a ragged groan. She was on her hands and knees, the fine silk of her stockings immediately snagged and stained by the coarse, rust-colored sand. *Filth.* The thought was sharp, visceral. *It's everywhere. In my hair, under my nails, a fine grit coating my tongue.* She fought the urge to gag. The heat was an oppressive blanket, the light a physical hammer against her skull, but it was the pervasive, inescapable grime that truly frayed at the edges of her composure. This was not the dignified hardship of battle; this was just squalor. The lack of control, of order, was an intolerable state, and her mind raced, not with clinical analysis, but with a desperate, frantic search for a single, actionable solution where none existed.

A quiet hiss escaped Blake Belladonna’s lips. It wasn't pain, not exactly. It was overload. Her Faunus senses, usually a precision instrument, were now a chaotic flood of raw, unfiltered data. The roar of the wind wasn't a sound; it was a million different frequencies at once. The heat wasn't a temperature; it was the kinetic energy of the air itself vibrating against her skin. The smell of the desert was an avalanche of information—baked stone, ozone, the specific mineral tang of the dust. It was a tidal wave of input that threatened to drown her, and it took a conscious, disciplined effort to build mental dams, to filter the screaming chaos into something that she could even begin to process as a threat assessment.

“Gah, it’s so… hot!” Yang Xiao Long’s complaint was a burst of raw, frustrated energy. She shoved herself upright, her golden hair a heavy cascade. The heat was a personal insult, pressing in on her, soaking through her clothes. A wave of visceral anger surged through her, a familiar fire that had nothing to do with her Semblance. She wanted to hit something. Her prosthetic arm whirred softly as she clenched her fist, her protective instinct a bonfire that burned hotter than the desert sun.

Jaune Arc didn’t speak. He simply pushed himself into a sitting position, the movement slow, deliberate. This younger body was a familiar vessel, yet this world was not its proper sea. The feel of his own smooth hands, the cadence of his breathing, these were constants he had relearned, but they were set against an entirely new and hostile variable. He drew a breath, and the hot, sandy air was real. The grief for Penny, for Lewis, for the time he had lost, was a quiet, heavy stone in his gut, a weight he had carried out of that world and into this one.

A name, raw and desperate, tore through the wind as Ruby forced herself to her feet, swaying. "Weiss?" The word was a test, a fragile filament of sound sent out into the roaring static, a desperate hope for a single, reassuring data point.

“Here!” The reply was sharp, a shard of crystal defying the oppressive heat. As she spoke, Weiss pushed her hands against the burning sand, the pain a focusing agent. *I am here. I am solid. I will not break.* The thought was a shield she raised.

“Blake!” Yang’s voice was a stronger bark, but it was edged with a tremor she couldn't suppress. Her gaze was locked on the tense silhouette of her partner, a thousand questions she couldn't yet ask caught in her throat.

From the watchful figure came a quiet, strained, “Here.” Blake didn’t turn, her focus a monumental effort of filtering the sensory chaos. *Yang, voice is strong, scared but strong. Weiss, sharp as ever. Ruby is on her feet. Good.* The analysis was a small island of calm she carved out for herself.

Ruby’s head turned, the motion slow, her silver eyes finding each of them before settling on the quiet knight. Her voice was thin, almost lost. “Jaune?”

He looked up, meeting her gaze from the ground, his blue eyes a startling patch of color. He gave a single, slow nod. “Here.” And in his mind, a silent addition. *Here. Now. What now?*

Finally, Yang’s gaze snapped back to her sister, her own lilac eyes wide with a storm of emotions, needing the final anchor. “Ruby?”

“I’m here,” Ruby breathed, the words a final, shaky confirmation that grounded her. But the confirmation did not bring relief. The silence that fell between them after her words was heavier than the heat, broken only by the shriek of the wind. She looked from Weiss’s clenched jaw to Blake’s rigid posture, to Yang shifting her weight from foot to foot as if preparing for a fight with an invisible opponent. Her own gaze lifted to the horizon, a perfect, unbroken line where the red sand met the pale, empty sky. Her mind frantically searched for a landmark, a plan, a single next step, and found only a terrifying, silent void. The sun beat down on the back of her neck, and for the first time, a true, cold dread began to seep into her bones, a feeling far more oppressive than gravity itself.
