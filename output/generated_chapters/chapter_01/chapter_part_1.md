The world tore. Not a gentle unraveling, but a violent ripping of reality. One heartbeat, the ethereal nothingness of the Ever After; the next, a searing inferno of heat slamming into Ruby like a physical blow.  Her eyes snapped open, the blinding Vacuan sun a white, merciless predator in the vast expanse of sky. The ground, solid and unforgiving, rushed up to meet her as she landed hard, the impact jarring through her newly reformed body.  Sand, coarse and burning, scoured her skin. *Air*, blessed, scorching *air*, filled her lungs with a ragged gasp.  Disjointed thoughts, fragments of memory and unreality, swirled within her skull. *Where…? How…?*

Weiss landed beside her, a choked sound escaping her lips.  Her face, pale beneath a sheen of sweat, was a mask of tightly controlled panic.  Internally, a frantic litany played out: *Control, Weiss. Breathe. Assess.* The harsh reality of the desert, the raw, untamed energy of it, grated against her sensibilities. *Dust. So much dust.*  She could feel it coating her tongue, a gritty film in her mouth. *This isn't… This can't be…*

A low growl rumbled beside them, and Blake pushed herself up, her feline ears flattened against her head.  The cacophony of the desert assaulted her heightened senses – the rasp of the wind, the whispering sand, the relentless pounding of the sun.  A primal fear, a deep-seated instinct to flee, pulsed through her. *Danger. Exposure. We’re vulnerable.*  Her hand instinctively went to Gambol Shroud, a small measure of comfort in this chaotic landscape.

Yang let out a frustrated roar, the sound raw and untamed.  The sudden transition, the brutal shift from the nebulous Ever After to this harsh, physical world, left her feeling disoriented and enraged.  *Again! We're back to this?* A wave of protectiveness, fierce and burning, washed over her as she looked at her teammates, scattered and vulnerable. *Gotta get them together. Gotta figure this out.*

A few feet away, Jaune stirred. He pushed himself up slowly, his movements deliberate, almost mechanical.  Outwardly, he was a picture of quiet stoicism. But within, a storm raged.  The grief for Pyrrha, a dull ache that never truly faded, was intensified by the disorientation of their arrival. *Another world. Another fight.*  He blinked, trying to focus on the swirling sand and the shimmering heat haze. *We made it back. We’re… alive.*

Ruby’s voice, thin and reedy, broke the silence. “Weiss…?”

Weiss, struggling to regain her composure, swallowed hard.  “Here, Ruby.” Her voice was strained, each word a monumental effort.

“Blake? Yang?” Ruby’s gaze darted around, her silver eyes wide with a mixture of fear and relief.

Blake nodded, her amber eyes scanning their surroundings. "Present."  Her voice was raspy, dry.  The desert air felt like it was stealing the moisture from her very lungs.

Yang groaned, pushing herself up to a sitting position. "Ugh... yeah. I'm here."  The heat radiating from the sand seemed to intensify the burning frustration within her.

“Jaune?” Ruby’s voice was barely a whisper.  The memory of his grief, his quiet strength, was a heavy weight on her heart.

“Here,” Jaune replied, his voice low and steady.  The familiar weight of Crocea Mors in his hand was a small anchor in the swirling chaos.

Five figures, huddled together amidst the endless expanse of sand and sky.  Five souls, grappling with the violent return to reality.  The weight of gravity, the feel of their own bodies, the harshness of the Vacuan sun – it was all too much, too soon. They were back, yes.  But back to *what*?  The question hung in the air, heavy and unanswered, as the desert wind whipped around them, a constant, whispering reminder of their vulnerability.
