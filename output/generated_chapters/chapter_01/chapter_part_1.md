**[Begin Section 1-A]**

The world tears itself into existence not with a gentle fade, but with a cataclysm of sensation. One moment, the non-space of the Ever After, a place of whimsical physics and conceptual reality. The next, a furnace blast of heat, a blinding white sun, and the solid, unforgiving ground that meets them with a brutal, percussive shock. They don't land; they are violently expelled, a tangle of limbs and stunned cries swallowed by the immense, howling emptiness.

Sand. The first coherent thought in Ruby Rose’s mind is sand. It’s a gritty, invasive presence in her mouth, coating her tongue and the back of her throat. It’s in her eyes, a million tiny needles of silica that make her clench them shut, though the light of the alien sun still burns a searing red through her eyelids. Gravity, raw and unyielding, is a physical weight pressing her into the scorching ground. It’s a sensation so primal, so utterly *Remnant*, that it’s almost more disorienting than the fall. After the floaty surrealism of the Ever After, this oppressive heaviness feels like a betrayal. A ragged cough escapes her, expelling a puff of dust. Her lungs burn, not with magic or existential dread, but with the simple, agonizing need for clean air.

*Real. This feels… real.* The thought is a fragile spark in the overwhelming sensory deluge. The wind isn't a whimsical breeze; it’s a physical force, a scouring whip that peels moisture from her skin and screams past her ears with a high, predatory howl. She forces her eyes open. The world is a blur of shimmering heat haze, a vibrating curtain of light that makes the distant, skeletal rock formations dance and warp. Her silver eyes, wide with shock, reflect the merciless white disk of the sun. The sheer, unadulterated hostility of this place is a physical blow.

A few feet away, Weiss Schnee pushes herself to her knees with a sharp, controlled gasp. Her initial reaction is not panic, but a furious, internal battle for composure. *Analyze. Assess. Do not succumb.* The mantra repeats in her head, a desperate shield against the chaos. The heat is suffocating, turning the pristine white of her combat dress a dingy tan with sweat and grime. Each grain of sand feels like an abrasive insult against her skin. Her gaze, narrowed to a precise slit against the glare, sweeps the horizon. Nothing. Only sand, rock, and a sky of such a vast, pale, and unforgiving blue that it feels like a lid on a coffin. The sheer emptiness is an affront to her sensibilities, a canvas devoid of detail, of life, of anything but desolation. She feels a tremor of something alien—not fear, but a profound sense of misplacement, of being a meticulously crafted gear dropped into the wrong machine entirely.

Blake Belladonna’s return is an agony of heightened senses. While the others grapple with the light and heat, her Faunus ears are assaulted by the wind’s shriek, a complex symphony of frequencies that feels like sandpaper on her auditory nerves. The air smells of little but ozone, sun-baked stone, and the metallic tang of their own fear-scented sweat. Her body, already tensed from the fall, coils tighter. She’s acutely aware of their vulnerability, five small heartbeats in a colossal, indifferent wilderness. She pushes up, her movements fluid and cautious, her gaze darting not towards the horizon but towards her teammates. Her concern is an immediate, primal instinct. *Ruby? Yang?* The thought is a silent, desperate cry. The weight of Remnant’s atmosphere feels heavy on her shoulders, on the sensitive ears atop her head, a familiar pressure she hadn't realized she’d missed until it returned with such crushing force.

“Ugh, damn it!” Yang Xiao Long’s voice is a raw, frustrated growl, cutting through the wind’s howl. She shoves herself upright, her flesh-and-blood hand sinking into the hot sand while her metal prosthetic offers a solid, unyielding point of leverage. The heat is a personal challenge, a physical enemy to be met with her own internal fire. A wave of visceral frustration rolls through her—frustration at their fall, at their powerlessness, at this hostile, unknown world. Her lilac eyes blaze, scanning for threats, finding only the shimmering void. The lack of Ember Celica at her wrists is a phantom ache, a hollowness where a part of her soul should be. Her gaze locks onto Ruby, a small, crumpled shape against the ochre sand, and a fierce, protective inferno ignites in her chest, momentarily eclipsing all other sensations. She takes a half-step, her boots sinking, the sheer effort of movement a shocking reminder of their exhaustion.

Jaune Arc rises last, not with the pained stiffness of an old man, but with a slow, deliberate grace that seems entirely out of place. The brutal impact with the ground is a distant echo to him, a minor physical complaint against the vast, silent landscape of his own mind. He stands, his posture straight, his movements economical. The sun beats down on his familiar orange-accented hoodie, and the wind whips his blond hair across a face that is, impossibly, young. The weary lines, the long graying hair, the decades of sorrow etched into his skin—all gone. Yet, his eyes, a deep and startling blue, hold the unnerving depth of a man who has lived a lifetime in solitude. He looks at his hands, turning them over in the blinding light. They are the hands of a young man, uncalloused by the Rusted Knight’s gauntlets, unlined by age. The disconnect is a quiet, internal vertigo. He feels the oppressive heat, registers the howling wind, but they are just data points. His primary sensation is one of profound, soul-deep grief for the world he was forced to abandon, a grief that this harsh reality cannot touch.

“Everyone… sound off,” Ruby’s voice is raspy, thin against the vastness, but it carries the undeniable weight of a leader pulling herself together.

A beat of silence, punctuated only by the shrieking wind.

“Present,” Weiss answers, her tone clipped and tight, a dam holding back a flood of uncertainty.

“I’m here,” Blake says, her voice low and steady, a calming anchor in the sensory storm.

“Yeah. Here,” Yang grunts, her gaze still fixed on her sister, a silent promise of protection.

A longer pause hangs in the air, stretching thin. All eyes turn to the last figure.

Jaune looks at them, truly seeing them for the first time since the fall. His young face is a mask of stoicism, but his eyes are an open wound. “Here,” he says, his voice quiet but firm, carrying a resonance of newfound maturity that has nothing to do with age and everything to do with loss.

They stand together, a small, bewildered huddle against the terrifying scale of the desert. The initial, violent shock of their arrival has passed, leaving in its wake the cold, dawning realization of their situation. They have confirmed they are all present, all alive, all physically back on Remnant. But as they stare out at the endless expanse of sand and rock under the white-hot sun, the confirmation of their survival feels less like a victory and more like the beginning of an entirely new, and perhaps far more arduous, trial.
