The world tore itself into existence, not with a gentle unfolding, but with a visceral, almost agonizing rebirth. One heartbeat, the ethereal nothingness of the Ever After pressed against them, the next, the brutal reality of Vacuo slammed into their senses like a physical blow.  A furnace blast of heat seared Ruby’s lungs, stealing the very air from her throat. Blinding white light assaulted her retinas, leaving her vision awash in shimmering, distorted shapes.  Gravity, a forgotten force, yanked at her with savage insistence, slamming her into the unforgiving, scorching earth. Sand, coarse and burning, invaded every crevice of her clothing, grinding against her skin like a thousand tiny needles.

*Weiss… Blake… Yang… Jaune…*  The names formed silently on her tongue, a desperate prayer.  Were they here?  *Were they real?*  The Ever After had a way of twisting reality, of leaving behind echoes that weren't truly there.

"Nggh…" a low groan filtered through the roaring in her ears.  Ruby blinked, her vision slowly resolving into a blurry landscape of endless dunes and a sky so bright it felt like a physical pressure.

Weiss, her face pale and streaked with dust, lay a few feet away, one hand clutching her head as if warding off an invisible blow. The pristine white of her attire was already marred by the ubiquitous sand, a jarring contrast to the stark landscape. *Control,* a silent mantra whispered through Weiss's thoughts. *Regain control. Assess. Breathe.* The swirling chaos of their arrival fought against her ingrained need for order, every grain of sand a tiny insurrection against her composure.  The raw, unfiltered heat hammered against her skin, a suffocating blanket.  Her aura, a comforting presence mere moments ago, now felt thin and fragile, stretched taut like a spiderweb.

"Blake?"  Ruby croaked, her voice raspy.  The taste of dust coated her tongue.

A low, pained cough answered her.  Blake pushed herself up, her feline ears twitching nervously, picking up the subtle shifts in the wind, the whisper of sand against sand. The desert shrieked at her heightened senses, a cacophony of scorching air and blinding light.  *Danger,* her instincts screamed, a primal fear clawing at the edges of her mind. *Open. Exposed. Vulnerable.*  She scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of threat, any flicker of movement in the shimmering haze.

“Yang?” Ruby called out again, louder this time. Panic gnawed at her.

A guttural growl ripped through the air.  Yang, her fists clenched tight, slammed them into the sand, the impact sending a tremor through the ground.  Frustration, raw and untamed, radiated from her. "Damn it!" she roared, her voice thick with anger and disorientation. "Where… where are we?"  The Ever After hadn't just disoriented her; it had left her feeling stripped bare, her usual fiery energy replaced by a simmering, almost volcanic rage.  Her prosthetic arm, usually a source of strength, felt heavy and foreign. The phantom limb it replaced throbbed with a dull ache, a stark reminder of what she had lost.


Nearby, Jaune stirred. He sat up slowly, his face etched with a weariness that went beyond the physical. He blinked against the harsh sunlight, the vastness of the desert pressing in on him.  * Pyrrha...*  The thought drifted through his mind, a phantom ache in his chest. He pushed it down, burying it deep beneath a stoic mask.  He had to be strong. For his team.  For…  He wasn't sure for what anymore. Just strong. He took a deep breath, the hot, dry air burning his lungs. *Focus,* he told himself. *One step at a time.*

"Everyone… here?" Ruby's voice trembled, a fragile thread of hope in the overwhelming chaos.  A cough. A nod. A grunt of acknowledgement.  Four shadows against the blinding sun, drawn together in a small, bewildered huddle.  They were back.  On Remnant. In Vacuo.  But the Ever After still clung to them, a lingering unreality coloring the edges of their perception. The desert stretched before them, a vast, indifferent expanse of heat and sand.  They were home, yet they had never felt more lost.
