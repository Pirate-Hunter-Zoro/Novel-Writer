**Critic LLM Analysis Report:**

* **Directive 1: Word Count:** FAILED. Word count: 781.  Target range: 1000-1200.
* **Directive 2: `[EPIC_MOMENT_END]` Marker:** ABSENT.
* **Directive 3: Sustained Quality of Detail:** Quality Pacing Failure detected. While the initial descriptions are detailed, the "Central Mini-Event" (investigating the skiff) lacks the same depth of sensory detail and internal monologue. The narrative shifts towards action and plot progression at the expense of the excruciating detail demanded by the prompt.
* **Directive 4: Lore Consistency:**
    * **Inconsistency Detected:** Weiss identifies the Grimm as a "Sabyr."  The lore describes deep gouges.  Sabyrs use claws, but would leave slash marks, not gouges. A more consistent Grimm type would be something with powerful gripping claws capable of tearing metal, like a Beringel. See `rwby_grimm.md` (hypothetical file - this kind of detailed Grimm file was not included in the provided lore, but *should* exist for optimal lore consistency checks).
    * **Inconsistency Detected:** Yang's internal monologue expresses frustration at her helplessness and the thought "If I had been here..."  This contradicts Yang's established character arc of PTSD and trauma related to combat after losing her arm in a previous battle. While a protective instinct is consistent, the desire to have been present during a violent Grimm attack contradicts her current psychological state. See `rwby_characters.md`.
    * **Inconsistency Detected:** Jaune's internal monologue references Pyrrha's strategic thinking.  While Jaune admired Pyrrha, his established development focuses on Aura Amplification and leadership, not tactical analysis. It would be more consistent for Jaune to consider what a leader should do in this situation or how to best support his team. See `rwby_characters.md`.
