**Critic LLM Analysis Report:**

* **Directive 1: Word Count:**
    * **Result:** FAIL
    * **Details:** The generated text contains 791 words. The prompt specified a word count between 1000 and 1200.

* **Directive 2: `[EPIC_MOMENT_END]` Marker:**
    * **Result:** ABSENT
    * **Details:** The `[EPIC_MOMENT_END]` marker is missing from the generated text.

* **Directive 3: Sustained Quality of Detail:**
    * **Result:** Quality Pacing Failure
    * **Details:** While the initial paragraphs maintain a reasonable level of internal monologue and sensory detail, the narrative quickly shifts towards a more action-oriented summary as the characters begin to move. The prompt emphasized "EXCRUCIATING Detail" *throughout* the chapter. The central mini-event of discovering the glint of light lacks the immersive, sensory-driven description demanded by the prompt.

* **Directive 4: Lore Consistency:**
    * **Result:** FAIL
    * **Details:** Multiple lore inconsistencies detected:
        * **Failure Report 1:** Blake's heightened Faunus senses are mentioned as returning after the Ever After.  The Ever After did *not* suppress senses; it distorted reality. See `rwby_locations.md` for Ever After description.
        * **Failure Report 2:** Yang's semblance is described as feeling "sluggish."  Semblances are tied to Aura, not location. There's no lore basis for a Semblance being affected by transitioning between dimensions. See `rwby_lore_magic.md` for Semblance rules.
        * **Failure Report 3:** Jaune is described as feeling "strangelyâ€¦calm."  While character development is permitted, this contradicts his established, deeply emotional response to loss and responsibility, especially after Pyrrha's death and the events leading to the Ever After. See `rwby_characters.md` for Jaune's personality and arc.
        * **Failure Report 4:** Ruby uses the phrase "status report."  While minor, this feels out of character given her usual, more informal communication style. See `rwby_characters.md` for Ruby's personality and quirks.
