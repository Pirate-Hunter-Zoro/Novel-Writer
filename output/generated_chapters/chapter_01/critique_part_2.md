### **CRITIC_OUTPUT**

**FAIL:** The text describes the environment as a "roiling, perpetual tempest of bruised purple and abyssal black," which, while visually striking, partially deviates from the negative constraint. While the color palette and storm imagery are appropriately dark, the explicit absence of "a sky" suggests the presence of something *other than* a perpetual storm, such as a swirling vortex or chaotic abyss. This is still not entirely consistent with the established lore.
**NEGATIVE_CONSTRAINT:** The environment of Salem's domain must be a perpetual storm of darkness and tempestuous weather, without any hint of otherworldly phenomena like chaotic abysses or swirling voids.


**ACCEPTABLE DEVIATION:** While the generated text seems slightly shorter than the target range, it contains sufficient detail for analysis and demonstrates improvement towards fulfilling the prompt criteria.


**FAIL:** While Jaune's transformation *is* portrayed as sudden, the internal monologue dwells on the "absence of pain [as] a disquieting void," which contradicts the earlier directive to avoid lingering aches associated with returning to a youthful body. His focus should be on other adjustments. 
**NEGATIVE_CONSTRAINT:** Jaune must not focus on the lack of pain; his internal monologue should reflect on the sudden physical shift itself and his rapid adaptation.

**FAIL:** The text states Ruby dragged in a breath that "felt like swallowing shards of ice." While effective imagery, this relates to the temperature and not the texture of the air, which would be more consistent with dust and grit. 
**NEGATIVE_CONSTRAINT:** Ruby's breath must feel thick with dust and grit, not like "swallowing shards of ice."

**FAIL:** The text does not contain the descriptions of shimmering heat haze and the feel of sand and dust as required by the prompt.
**NEGATIVE_CONSTRAINT:** The descriptions must specifically include the texture of sand and dust on their skin and the distorting visual effects of a heat haze.

**FAIL:** The text uses the phrase "slick, jet-black ground" suggesting a wet or smooth surface rather than the sandy texture expected in a desert environment.
**NEGATIVE_CONSTRAINT:** The ground should have the texture of dry sand and rock.


**FAIL:** The text uses phrases like "freezing, needle-fine rain" and "invasive chill," which continue to emphasize cold rather than intense desert heat.
**NEGATIVE_CONSTRAINT:** Descriptions must emphasize the intense heat of a desert environment, not cold.
