The swirling chaos in Ruby’s mind began to settle, replaced by a grim determination.  She pushed herself to her feet, the unfamiliar weight of her body a tangible anchor in this alien landscape.  “Okay,” she said, her voice still rough, but gaining strength.  “We need to figure out where we are… and how to get out of here.”

Jaune, already on his feet, nodded, his gaze sweeping the horizon.  The vastness of the desert, stretching endlessly in every direction, was daunting. "Let's spread out," he suggested, his voice quiet but firm, a newfound maturity clinging to his words. "See if we can find anything… anything at all."

The team moved as one, a silent understanding passing between them. The oppressive silence of the desert pressed in, amplifying every crunch of their boots in the sand, every ragged breath. The heat, radiating from the pale sand, shimmered in the air, creating phantom images that danced at the edge of their vision.  The wind howled, a mournful cry that carried with it the faint whispers of… something.  Something unsettling.

Ruby’s own breath hitched in her throat. The Ever After… it felt like a lifetime ago, yet its echoes reverberated through her, a dissonant symphony of memory and loss.  She shook her head, trying to dispel the lingering unreality.  *Focus,* she told herself fiercely.  *We need to focus.*

Weiss, her initial panic receding, forced herself to methodically scan the horizon.  The glare was brutal, making her eyes water. She shielded them with a hand, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Each dune looked identical to the last, an endless repetition of sand and sky.  This stark, unforgiving landscape… it felt like a physical manifestation of her own inner turmoil.  *Control,* she repeated the mantra in her mind. *Observe. Analyze.*

Blake moved with a feline grace, her Faunus ears twitching, picking up the subtle nuances of the desert wind.  The Ever After, with its muted senses and ethereal stillness, had heightened her sensitivity to the physical world.  Now, every rustle of the wind, every distant cry of a desert bird, every grain of sand shifting beneath her feet, registered with almost painful clarity.  And then… she heard it.  A faint, rhythmic groan, carried on the wind, a sound that didn’t belong in this desolate landscape.  A sound of… metal.  Stressed metal.  Her breath hitched.

// **OR, if using Path B:**

Blake moved with a feline grace, her Faunus ears twitching, picking up the subtle nuances of the desert wind.  The Ever After… its strangeness still clung to her, a faint echo of unreality.  She shook her head, trying to clear the lingering disorientation.  *Focus,* she urged herself. *Protect.*

Weiss, her initial panic receding, forced herself to methodically scan the horizon. The glare was brutal, making her eyes water.  She shielded them with a hand, squinting against the shimmering heat haze.  And then she saw it.  A brief, unnatural glint of light, a flash of something that didn't belong in this monotonous landscape of sand and rock.  A reflection… off metal? Glass? It was gone as quickly as it appeared, but the image burned itself into her mind. *There!*  Her heart leaped with a sudden surge of hope.

// **Continuing from either Path A or B:**

Blake/Weiss froze, her body tensing.  “Did you…?” she began, her voice barely a whisper.

Simultaneously, the others stopped, their gazes drawn to her sudden stillness.

Blake/Weiss pointed a trembling finger towards the shimmering horizon. “There.”  A single word, laden with meaning.

All eyes turned to the indicated point, straining to see through the heat haze and swirling dust.  For a moment, there was nothing but the endless expanse of desert.  Then, as the wind shifted, a shape emerged from the shimmering air, a dark silhouette against the blinding white sky.  A small, battered transport skiff, half-buried in the sand.

A collective breath was drawn, a shared surge of hope in the face of despair.  They had a target.

### **Prompt 1-C: The Wreckage**

**Objective:** Continuing *immediately* from the discovery, this part covers their cautious approach to and detailed investigation of the *exterior* of the wrecked transport skiff.

**[Begin Section 1-C]**

**(Use the full text from Sections 1-A and 1-B as the preceding context.)**

With a shared target now identified, the team begins a cautious, tactical approach across the dunes toward the source of the sound or glint. Describe their movement as a team, falling back into old, familiar formations.

This section is a deep, forensic investigation of the crash site. As they get closer, describe the wreckage in vivid detail: a Shade Academy transport skiff, half-buried in a sand dune. Detail the evidence of a recent, violent conflict.

* Show the deep scorch marks and massive, gouging claw gashes that are clearly from a Grimm attack.
* Describe the scattered cargo—crates of Dust (some cracked and leaking), medical supplies trampled into the sand, and discarded personal effects.
* Use the characters' skills: Weiss analyzes the damage, identifying the likely Grimm type. Blake examines the sand, trying to distinguish between human and Grimm tracks, looking for signs of survivors. Yang, meanwhile, acts as an aggressive sentinel, her eyes constantly scanning the horizon for returning threats.

**Crucial Ending Point:** The section ends as they stand before the breached cockpit door, having fully assessed the exterior damage. They have determined it was a Grimm attack, but they don't know the fate of the crew. The decision to look inside is made.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** A medium shot showing the team investigating the exterior of the half-buried skiff. Weiss is touching a large Grimm-claw gash on the hull with an analytical expression, while Blake is crouched nearby, examining tracks in the sand. Yang stands guard in the background, alert and watching their backs.
