The world solidified around them, the initial chaos giving way to a grim, oppressive silence.  Ruby pushed herself up, her hands sinking into the scorching sand.  The heat radiated up through her palms, a tangible reminder of their harsh reality.  “Okay,” she croaked, her voice catching in her dry throat. “Everyone, check the horizon. Anything, anything at all.”

Jaune, swaying slightly, squinted.  He pointed a shaky finger towards the shimmering horizon. "Over there... maybe?"  It was nothing but heat haze, playing tricks on the eye.

Weiss, her face still pale, rose slowly, leaning on Myrtenaster for support. "I see nothing but sand," she whispered, her voice strained.

The wind howled across the desolate landscape, carrying with it a low, guttural moan that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the desert.  The sound sent a shiver down Ruby's spine, a primal unease.  It was a sound that didn’t belong, a sound that spoke of something ancient and malevolent.

Yang, her usual exuberance extinguished, simply nodded, her eyes scanning the undulating dunes.  The sand stretched out before them, a sea of white and ochre, broken only by the occasional wind-sculpted ripple.  Hopelessness began to creep into Ruby's heart.

**Path A:**

Blake stood motionless, her head tilted, her golden eyes narrowed.  Her ears, more sensitive than the others after the ethereal quiet of the Ever After, twitched.  Beneath the howl of the wind, beneath the whisper of the sand, she heard it. A faint, rhythmic groan of stressed metal, carried on the wind like a desperate plea. A sound utterly out of place in this desolate landscape.  Her breath caught.  “There,” she breathed, pointing towards a distant, shimmering rise. “Do you hear it?”

**Path B:**

Weiss, shielding her eyes against the glare, focused on the shimmering horizon, trying to pierce through the deceptive haze.  For a fleeting moment, a glint of light flashed through the shimmering air, too sharp, too defined to be a natural reflection.  A sliver of something metallic or glassy, reflecting the harsh sun where there should only be rock and sand. "There!" Weiss exclaimed, her voice sharp with sudden urgency.  She pointed towards a distant, barely discernible rise in the endless dunes.  "I saw something.  A reflection."

The others followed her gaze, their eyes drawn to the single point in the vast emptiness.  Hope, fragile but undeniable, flickered in their hearts.  A target.

### **Prompt 1-C: The Wreckage**

**Objective:** Continuing *immediately* from the discovery, this part covers their cautious approach to and detailed investigation of the *exterior* of the wrecked transport skiff.

**[Begin Section 1-C]**

**(Use the full text from Sections 1-A and 1-B as the preceding context.)**

With a shared target now identified, the team begins a cautious, tactical approach across the dunes toward the source of the sound or glint. Describe their movement as a team, falling back into old, familiar formations.

This section is a deep, forensic investigation of the crash site. As they get closer, describe the wreckage in vivid detail: a Shade Academy transport skiff, half-buried in a sand dune. Detail the evidence of a recent, violent conflict.

* Show the deep scorch marks and massive, gouging claw gashes that are clearly from a Grimm attack.
* Describe the scattered cargo—crates of Dust (some cracked and leaking), medical supplies trampled into the sand, and discarded personal effects.
* Use the characters' skills: Weiss analyzes the damage, identifying the likely Grimm type. Blake examines the sand, trying to distinguish between human and Grimm tracks, looking for signs of survivors. Yang, meanwhile, acts as an aggressive sentinel, her eyes constantly scanning the horizon for returning threats.

**Crucial Ending Point:** The section ends as they stand before the breached cockpit door, having fully assessed the exterior damage. They have determined it was a Grimm attack, but they don't know the fate of the crew. The decision to look inside is made.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** A medium shot showing the team investigating the exterior of the half-buried skiff. Weiss is touching a large Grimm-claw gash on the hull with an analytical expression, while Blake is crouched nearby, examining tracks in the sand. Yang stands guard in the background, alert and watching their backs.
