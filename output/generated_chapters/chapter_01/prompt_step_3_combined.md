(Continuing from Section 1-A)

The initial wave of disorientation receded, replaced by the cold grip of survival instinct.  Ruby, pushing herself to her feet, brushed the sand from her clothes.  “Okay,” she said, her voice still rough but gaining strength.  “Everyone, check the horizon. Anything – anything at all.”

Jaune, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, shakily rose to his feet. He scanned the endless expanse of dunes, shielding his eyes.  “Just… sand,” he croaked, his voice still tinged with nausea. “Nothing but sand.”

Weiss remained huddled on the ground, a tremor running through her.  The vast emptiness mirrored the void they’d just escaped, and the fear threatened to pull her back under.  Blake, however, was already on her feet, her feline ears twitching, head cocked to one side.  She seemed to be listening to something beyond the howl of the wind.

Yang joined Ruby, her gaze sweeping the horizon.  "Nothing," she muttered. The oppressive heat beat down on them, the air thick and still.  The silence, broken only by the mournful cry of the wind, was almost as disorienting as the initial arrival. The wind seemed to carry whispers, strange, unsettling sounds that danced at the edge of hearing. The heat haze shimmered above the dunes, playing tricks on their eyes, making the landscape shift and writhe.

A faint, rhythmic groan, almost lost in the wind, reached Blake's ears.  It was a metallic sound, a low, guttural thrum that spoke of strained metal and something… mechanical. A sound utterly alien to this desolate landscape.  She focused, her Faunus senses, sharpened by the sensory deprivation of the Ever After, cutting through the wind’s whispers. The sound pulsed again, a steady, rhythmic groan.  She turned, her eyes scanning the shimmering horizon, searching for the source.

*Path A*

The sound grew slightly louder, a steady pulse against the backdrop of wind and silence.  Blake pointed towards a distant dune, barely visible through the heat haze.  “There,” she whispered, her voice urgent. “I hear something.”

*Path B*

Weiss, forcing herself to stand, shielded her eyes against the blinding glare.  As her gaze swept across the undulating dunes, she caught a flicker of light, a brief, unnatural glint embedded in the shimmering heat haze.  It was a reflection, sharp and metallic, out of place in this desolate landscape of rock and sand.  “There!” she exclaimed, pointing towards the source.  "I see something!"

Four pairs of eyes snapped towards the distant point, a sudden, shared focus in the vast emptiness.  Hope, fragile but fierce, ignited in their chests.  They had a target.

### **Prompt 1-C: The Wreckage**

**Objective:** Continuing *immediately* from the discovery, this part covers their cautious approach to and detailed investigation of the *exterior* of the wrecked transport skiff.

**[Begin Section 1-C]**

**(Use the full text from Sections 1-A and 1-B as the preceding context.)**

With a shared target now identified, the team begins a cautious, tactical approach across the dunes toward the source of the sound or glint. Describe their movement as a team, falling back into old, familiar formations.

This section is a deep, forensic investigation of the crash site. As they get closer, describe the wreckage in vivid detail: a Shade Academy transport skiff, half-buried in a sand dune. Detail the evidence of a recent, violent conflict.

* Show the deep scorch marks and massive, gouging claw gashes that are clearly from a Grimm attack.
* Describe the scattered cargo—crates of Dust (some cracked and leaking), medical supplies trampled into the sand, and discarded personal effects.
* Use the characters' skills: Weiss analyzes the damage, identifying the likely Grimm type. Blake examines the sand, trying to distinguish between human and Grimm tracks, looking for signs of survivors. Yang, meanwhile, acts as an aggressive sentinel, her eyes constantly scanning the horizon for returning threats.

**Crucial Ending Point:** The section ends as they stand before the breached cockpit door, having fully assessed the exterior damage. They have determined it was a Grimm attack, but they don't know the fate of the crew. The decision to look inside is made.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** A medium shot showing the team investigating the exterior of the half-buried skiff. Weiss is touching a large Grimm-claw gash on the hull with an analytical expression, while Blake is crouched nearby, examining tracks in the sand. Yang stands guard in the background, alert and watching their backs.
