The world tore itself into existence, not with a gentle unfolding, but with the brutal finality of a slammed door.  One heartbeat, the ethereal, non-Euclidean space of the Ever After. The next, an inferno of heat slammed into them, a sun so bright it bleached the sky to a merciless white, and the crushing, undeniable reality of solid ground.

Ruby gasped, a strangled sound lost in the howl of the wind. Her vision swam, the blinding glare a physical blow.  Sand, coarse and burning, stung her skin. _Real.  This is… real._ The thought clawed its way through the disorientation, a fragile lifeline in a sea of sensory overload.  Gravity, a forgotten burden, anchored her to the earth with an almost painful intensity.  She tasted dust, felt the grit of it between her teeth.  Her body, her own familiar weight, felt both alien and achingly familiar.

“Weiss!” The cry tore from her throat, raw and desperate.  _They had to be here.  They had to._

A choked cough echoed beside her.  “Ruby…?”  Weiss’s voice, thin and reedy, was barely audible above the wind’s incessant scream. Ruby blinked, struggling to focus.  Weiss lay sprawled beside her, one hand shielding her eyes, her face pale beneath a sheen of sweat.  Relief, sharp and piercing, lanced through Ruby. One down.

“Blake! Yang! Jaune!”

A low groan reached her ears. Yang stirred, pushing herself up onto one elbow, her face a mask of pain.  A phantom ache pulsed in the space where her arm should have been, a ghost of agony resurrected by the brutal return to reality.  The heat seemed to amplify it, turning the phantom limb into a burning brand.  _No._ She fought back the rising panic, the familiar wave of vulnerability threatening to drown her.  _Not now. Not again._

Blake scrambled to her feet, her cat ears flattened against her head, her breath coming in ragged gasps. The desert air, superheated and thick with the scent of dust and something acrid she couldn’t place, assaulted her nostrils.  Her enhanced hearing, normally a blessing, was overwhelmed by the cacophony – the relentless wind, the whispering sand, the distant, mournful cry of some unseen desert creature. The light, amplified by the endless expanse of sand, seared her eyes, even through closed lids.  She swayed, momentarily dizzy, the sudden influx of stimuli threatening to overload her senses.

“Blake!” Ruby cried, relief flooding her as she saw the Faunus struggle to her feet.  “Are you alright?”

Blake swallowed, forcing down the nausea.  “Just… overwhelmed,” she managed, her voice hoarse.

A low groan from nearby drew their attention.  Jaune lay on his back, eyes closed, his face etched with an exhaustion that went far deeper than mere physical fatigue. He felt the grit of sand against his cheek, the scorching heat baking his skin.  _This is…real._ The thought echoed in his mind, a hollow refrain against the backdrop of a thousand other, more complex emotions.  Relief warred with lingering grief, the echoes of the Ever After clinging to him like shadows.  He had faced his fears, confronted his past, but the weight of it remained, a constant pressure in his chest. _Pyrrha…_  The name surfaced, a phantom ache in his soul.  He opened his eyes, the harsh glare of the sun forcing him to squint. _I’m here. I’m back._  But a part of him, a small, fragile piece, remained lost in the ethereal landscape of memory.

“Jaune!”  Ruby’s voice, sharp with concern, cut through the fog of his thoughts.  He pushed himself upright, his movements slow and deliberate.

“Yeah,” he managed, his voice rough. “I’m… here.”

Ruby looked at each of them in turn, her silver eyes wide with a mixture of relief and lingering disorientation.  “Everyone… everyone’s here.”  The words were a statement, a question, a prayer.

Weiss, still struggling to regain her composure, nodded. “Present,” she managed, her voice strained.

“Here,” Blake confirmed, her voice still rough.

Yang, her jaw clenched, gave a curt nod.  The phantom pain throbbed, a constant, unwelcome reminder of her loss.

Jaune met Ruby’s gaze, a flicker of understanding passing between them. They were back. They were alive.  But the Ever After had changed them, left its mark on their souls.  They were home, but they weren’t the same.  They were adrift in a hostile world, the oppressive heat, the endless expanse of sand, the relentless wind their only companions.
