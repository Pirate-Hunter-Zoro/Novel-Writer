### **CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY (Include in each prompt)**

* **Word Count Goal:** This section *must* be between 1000 and 1200 words.  Prioritize expanding descriptions, internal monologues, and physical sensations to meet this requirement.  The previous iteration failed to reach this minimum.
* **MAXIMIZE Immersive Sensory Details:** Describe the heat, the feel of sand and dust, the quality of the blinding light and shimmering air, the howling wind, and the sounds of ragged breathing with extreme vividness.
* **PROFOUND Individual Character Resonance & Internal Monologue:** Dedicate significant portions of the narrative to each character's deepest inner thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations.  Expand the existing internal monologues to meet the depth and complexity expected.
  * **Ruby:** Disoriented processing, lingering unreality, the weight of leadership, renewed resolve.
  * **Weiss:** Struggle to maintain composure, sharp observations, internal battle for control.
  * **Blake:** Heightened Faunus senses, cautious awareness, deep concern for her team. *Provide SPECIFIC sensory details related to her Faunus heritage — how does the desert air smell, what specific sounds does she hear, how does the light affect her vision?*
  * **Yang:** Visceral frustration, burning protective instinct, raw energy of her emotions. *Crucially, incorporate her PTSD and vulnerability related to her missing arm. DO NOT include phantom limb pain; she has a prosthetic.*
  * **Jaune:** Quiet stoicism masking profound internal processing, newfound maturity, lingering grief. *Expand his internal monologue significantly, reflecting his experiences in the Ever After and his changed perspective. His reaction to returning should acknowledge his growth and closure regarding Pyrrha's death.* See `rwby_characters.md` for Jaune Arc's Ever After arc.
* **"Show, Don't Tell" - In EXCRUCIATING Detail:** Use minute character actions, extensive internal monologues, and nuanced dialogue. AVOID generic descriptions. Every character must have a distinct, individual reaction.
* **Rich and Varied Language:** Utilize a sophisticated and expansive vocabulary with diverse, complex sentence structures. ELIMINATE repetitive phrasing.
* **Physicality of Return:** Describe how their physical bodies feel after their Ever After transformations—the profound sensation of gravity, lingering oddities, and the return of familiar aches. The current draft is lacking in these details. *Provide specific descriptions of how each character's body feels—the weight of their limbs, the texture of their clothing, any lingering sensations from the Ever After, the return of old injuries or phantom pains (excluding Yang's phantom limb pain, as she has a prosthetic), the taste and smell of the air.*

### **Prompt 1-A: Arrival and Disorientation (REVISED)**

**Objective:** Generate the first part of Chapter 1, "Dust and Desert". The *only* focus is the immediate, shocking arrival of Team RWBY and Jaune Arc in Vacuo.  Specifically, they arrive in the vast expanse of the Shifting Sands desert outside Vacuo. Describe recognizable landmarks or features to solidify the location.

**[Begin Section 1-A]**

The world tears itself into existence around them not with a gentle fade, but with a cataclysm of sensation. One moment, the non-space of the Ever After. The next, a furnace blast of heat, a blinding white sun, and the solid, unforgiving ground of the Shifting Sands desert outside of Vacuo.  Describe the swirling sand and shimmering heat haze, the distant, broken silhouettes of mesas, and the oppressive, windless heat that radiates from the pale dunes.

This section must focus *exclusively* on the first few minutes of their return. The core of this text should be their profound disorientation and the overwhelming sensory input of the Vacuan desert. Detail their individual internal monologues as they grapple with the sudden, violent shift in reality. Their initial dialogue should be sparse, broken, and confused as they try to understand where they are and what has happened. The environment itself—the oppressive heat, the grit of sand, the vast, empty sky—is the primary antagonist of this section.

**Address the following specific issues from the previous generation:**

* **Word Count:** Ensure this section is between 1000 and 1200 words. The previous attempt only reached 773 words.
* **Yang's Reaction:** Include fear, vulnerability, and potential malfunction or damage to her prosthetic arm, alongside her anger.  DO NOT include phantom limb pain. Refer to `rwby_characters.md` for details on Yang's trauma history.
* **Jaune's Internal Monologue:** Deepen and expand his thoughts. Include reflections on his Ever After experiences, his changed perspective, and his struggle to process the return.  Acknowledge his growth and the closure he experienced regarding Pyrrha. Refer to `rwby_characters.md` and `rwby_plot_events.md`, Volume 9.
* **Blake's Sensory Details:** Provide *specific*, detailed descriptions of how her Faunus senses react to the Vacuan desert. How does the air smell? What sounds does she hear? How does the light affect her vision?
* **Physicality of Return:** Add detailed descriptions of how each character's body *feels* — the weight of their limbs, the pull of gravity, the texture of their clothing against their skin, any lingering odd sensations from the Ever After, the return of old injuries, potential damage to Yang's prosthetic arm, the taste of the air, etc.
* **Neo's Absence:**  Neo entered the Ever After separately. Do not include her in this arrival scene.
* **Explicit Location:** Clearly establish that the characters have arrived in the Shifting Sands desert outside of Vacuo.


**Crucial Ending Point:** The section must end after they have taken their first roll call, confirmed they are all present and physically back on Remnant, but before they have decided on any course of action. They are a small, bewildered huddle in a vast, hostile world.  Include the `[EPIC_MOMENT_END]` marker directly after the ending point.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** A tight, disorienting shot focusing on Ruby's face. Her silver eyes are wide with shock, reflecting a blindingly white sun. The background is a blur of swirling sand and shimmering heat haze, conveying a sense of overwhelming sensory input.  Include a broken mesa silhouette in the background to establish the Vacuo setting.
