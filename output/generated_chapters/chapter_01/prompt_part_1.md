### **Prompt 1-A: Arrival and Disorientation**

**Objective:** Generate the first part of Chapter 1, "Dust and Desert". The *only* focus is the immediate, shocking arrival of Team RWBY and Jaune Arc in Vacuo.

**[Begin Section 1-A]**

The world tears itself into existence around them not with a gentle fade, but with a cataclysm of sensation. One moment, the non-space of the Ever After. The next, a furnace blast of heat, a blinding white sun, and the solid, unforgiving ground.

This section must focus *exclusively* on the first few minutes of their return. The core of this text should be their profound disorientation and the overwhelming sensory input of the Vacuan desert. Detail their individual internal monologues as they grapple with the sudden, violent shift in reality. Their initial dialogue should be sparse, broken, and confused as they try to understand where they are and what has happened. The environment itself—the oppressive heat, the grit of sand, the vast, empty sky—is the primary antagonist of this section.

**Crucial Ending Point:** The section must end after they have taken their first roll call, confirmed they are all present and physically back on Remnant, but before they have decided on any course of action. They are a small, bewildered huddle in a vast, hostile world.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** A tight, disorienting shot focusing on Ruby's face. Her silver eyes are wide with shock, reflecting a blindingly white sun. The background is a blur of swirling sand and shimmering heat haze, conveying a sense of overwhelming sensory input.
