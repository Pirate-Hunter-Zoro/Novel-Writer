**Critic LLM Analysis Report:**

* **Directive 1: Word Count:**
    * **Result:** FAIL
    * **Details:** The generated text contains 773 words. The prompt specified a word count between 1000 and 1200 words.

* **Directive 2: `[EPIC_MOMENT_END]` Marker:**
    * **Result:** PRESENT

* **Directive 3: Sustained Quality of Detail:**
    * **Result:** No Quality Pacing Failure Detected (because the chapter is only the initial arrival scene, there's no "Central Mini-Event" yet to compare against)

* **Directive 4: Lore Consistency:**
    * **Result:** FAIL
    * **Failure Report 1:** Inconsistency Detected: Yang's reaction includes phantom limb pain. While she lost her arm in Volume 3, she received a prosthetic replacement in Volume 4. The prosthetic arm may malfunction or be damaged, but phantom limb pain would not be lore-accurate. See `rwby_characters.md` and `rwby_plot_events.md`, Volumes 3 and 4.
    * **Failure Report 2:** Inconsistency Detected: Jaune's internal monologue references Pyrrha as a recent loss. While Pyrrha's death remains a significant emotional event, Jaune's experiences in the Ever After (Volume 9) provided him with a degree of closure and personal growth, which should temper his immediate reaction. See `rwby_characters.md` and `rwby_plot_events.md`, Volume 9.
    * **Failure Report 3:** Inconsistency Detected: The generated text implies that Team RWBY, Jaune, and Neopolitan arrived in the Ever After at the same time. The lore establishes that they fell in separately during the Fall of Atlas. Ruby, Weiss, Blake, Yang, and Jaune entered together, while Neo fell in independently. See `rwby_plot_events.md`, Volumes 8 and 9.  Also, Neo is not present in the scene, so a later revision will need to address why she was not pulled through with the others, or provide a specific note about her separate arrival.
    * **Failure Report 4:** Inconsistency Detected:  While the prompt stated a Vacuo arrival, and the prompt included the phrase "the Vacuan desert," the generated text lacks *any* mention of specific locations, landmarks, or anything that explicitly confirms Vacuo.  The prompt demanded "EXCRUCIATING detail." Merely stating "desert" does not meet that requirement.
