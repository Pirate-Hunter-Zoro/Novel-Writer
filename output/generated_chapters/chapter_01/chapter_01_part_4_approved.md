The world returned not as a gentle dawn, but as a physical assault.

For Ruby, the first sensation was gravity. In the Ever After, especially after the Tree, her form had felt weightless, her mind boundless, a profound, quiet certainty that she was *enough*. She had soared on currents of pure acceptance. Now, gravity was a vindictive master, a brute force that slammed her into the scorched earth and held her there. Her shoulder blades, where the weight of leadership had so recently felt lifted, now screamed with a dull, grinding ache, a phantom pain for the peace she no longer possessed.

She pushed herself up, her palm sinking into sand that was not merely hot, but felt like a bed of dying embers. A gasp tore from her throat, a raw, ragged sound alien to the lightness she’d just known. The air she dragged into her lungs was a superheated particulate, thick with dust that coated her tongue and grated at the back of her throat. She blinked, and the light was a physical blow. A blinding, featureless white that bleached the world of colour and detail, leaving only the shimmering, distorted veil of heat rising from the ground in hallucinatory waves. The sun was not a benevolent star; it was a malevolent eye, a white-hot forge hanging in a bleached-blue sky, intent on rendering them to ash.

*Breathe,* she commanded herself, but the order was lost in the body’s desperate, instinctual panic. *Think. You are Ruby Rose. You led them here. You fell. But you came back. This… this is just heat. Just sand.*

But it wasn’t. It was the crushing reality of mortality. She could feel the thrumming of her own heart, a frantic, fleshy drumbeat in her ears. She could feel the slick, salty sting of sweat tracing paths of grime down her temples. These were sensations that felt terrifyingly crude after the clarity of Ascension.

Her gaze swept to the others. Weiss was curled into a tight ball, her face buried in her arms, her slight frame shuddering. Nearby, Blake was on her knees, hands pressed hard against her cat ears. The wind was another tormentor, a sculptor of miseries. It didn’t whisper; it shrieked, a high, keening wail that was pure agony for her faunus hearing, driving crystalline dust into every pore, every fold of cloth, a constant, abrasive torment. Yang was grimly pushing herself up, her metal arm already searing hot against her skin, a brutal reminder of old pains.

A few yards away, Jaune was on his hands and knees, head bowed as he coughed, a dry, hacking retch that produced nothing but a spray of dust. He spat, a thick, gritty motion of pure disgust.

For Weiss, the world was a vortex of sensory agony. The Ever After had been a place of cool, silvered moss underfoot, of air that tasted of sweet tea and possibility. Here, the world was an abrasive blanket of fire and grit. The sand wasn't just in her clothes; she could feel it between her teeth, under her eyelids, a thousand tiny needles scraping at the delicate membranes of her mortal body. Her skin, which had felt like her own again in that strange world, free from the porcelain artifice of her father's home, was now just… skin. Prickling, burning, vulnerable. A sob caught in her throat, hot and dry. The tears wouldn’t come. Her body didn’t have the moisture to spare.

*This is a punishment,* her mind whimpered. *We were cast out. Back into the clay. Back into the pain.* She could feel the pulse in her wrist, a frantic, animal rhythm. It felt so fragile, so temporary. A little bird trapped in a cage of bone, fluttering against its inevitable end.

Jaune, however, was already fighting back. The initial shock had hit him like a physical blow, the return to his younger body a claustrophobic nightmare. As the Rusted Knight, he had been a creature of weary resilience and iron will, his aged form a familiar shell. He could feel the ache in his bones before a storm. Now, his perception was slammed shut into this too-small, too-light prison of his own youth. He spat again, trying to clear the filth from his mouth. He forced his gaze to lift, squinting against the glare. The world was flat, hostile, and infuriatingly opaque.

*Analyze,* his mind snapped, a drill sergeant’s bark over the howl of the wind. *Complaint is a luxury. Observation is survival.* His eyes, sharper and more practiced than the others, began to dissect the horizon. Endless dunes, yes, but not without feature. To the west, the relentless waves of sand rose higher, coalescing into a long, jagged ridge of darker rock, its peaks distorted by the shimmering air. It looked like a broken spine jutting from the desert’s corpse.

Shelter. The word formed, clear and cold, in his mind.

“Ruby.”

His voice was a croak, almost stolen by the wind. He tried again, louder, forcing the sound from his raw throat. “Ruby!”

Ruby’s head snapped toward him. The simple act of turning her neck sent a protest through her muscles. She saw the focus in Jaune’s eyes, the hard-won clarity of the Rusted Knight, and it was enough to shatter her own paralysis. He was looking to her. They all were.

She pushed herself to her feet, a monumental effort. Her legs trembled, unused to bearing her full, leaden weight. She stumbled over to Weiss, her boots sinking into the deep sand. She knelt, her knee screaming at the impact.

“Weiss,” she said, her voice softer but no less strained. “Look at me.”

Weiss flinched but slowly, agonizingly, lifted her head. Her face was smudged with dirt, her lips already cracked. Despair swam in her eyes. “It hurts,” she whispered, the sound barely audible. “Everything is… loud. And sharp.”

“I know,” Ruby said, and in that moment, the shared misery was a strange and terrible bond. “But we can’t stay here. We’ll be baked alive.”

“The ridge,” Jaune said, joining them. He didn’t bother to brush the sand from his clothes; it was a futile gesture. He pointed, his arm a stark line against the white sky. “To the west. Maybe a mile. There could be overhangs. Caves. Shade.”

Shade. The word was a prayer. A promise of relief so profound it was almost painful to contemplate.

Ruby looked from the desperate hope on Jaune’s face to the fragile terror on Weiss’s. The path forward began to solidify, clearing the fog of shock. Strategy, not sorrow, was what they needed now.

“He’s right,” Ruby affirmed, her voice gaining a sliver of its old authority. “Our objective is clear. First, shelter. We get to that ridge.” She paused, her gaze scanning their meager possessions—the tattered remnants of their Ever After clothes, nothing more. “Second, supplies. We need water above all else. Shelter first, then we search. Third…” she hesitated, the immensity of their situation threatening to overwhelm her again. “Third, information. We need to know where we are. *When* we are. If there are people.”

Blake lowered her hands from her ears, her expression grim but focused. The pragmatism of the plan was a rock to cling to in the sea of her pain. “We have to watch out for each other,” she added, her voice gaining strength. “If one of us falters, we all fall. We move together.”

Yang nodded, forcing herself upright next to Blake. “One mile. In this heat, it might as well be a hundred,” she said, her voice a low growl. “We need to pace ourselves. Conserve every drop of energy.”

A plan. It was fragile, born of desperation and whispered in the face of a gale, but it was a plan. It was a purpose. The emotional storm began to recede, replaced by the cold, sharp focus of necessity. They were no longer lost children lamenting a strange paradise. They were survivors.

Ruby met Jaune’s gaze, then Yang’s, Blake’s, and Weiss’s, seeing her own grim determination mirrored back at her. She stood, offering a hand to Weiss. She took it, her grip surprisingly firm. Together, they pulled her to her feet. The five of them stood for a moment, a tiny, defiant island in a vast ocean of hostile sand and sky, their shadows stark and short beneath the tyrannical sun.

“To the ridge,” Ruby said, her voice clear and hard above the wind.

She took the first step. One foot. Then the other. A pilgrimage back to the land of the living.
