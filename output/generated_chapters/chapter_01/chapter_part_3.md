The shimmering mirage solidified into wreckage.  A Shade Academy transport skiff, half-swallowed by the unforgiving dune, lay before them like a beached leviathan.  With a shared, unspoken understanding, they moved as one, falling into a familiar diamond formation.  Yang, a coiled spring of barely contained energy, took point, her golden eyes sweeping the horizon.  Blake, silent and feline, flanked her, senses heightened, each rustle of wind-blown sand scrutinized.  Ruby, the weight of leadership a tangible pressure in her chest, formed the apex, Crescent Rose held loosely but ready.  Weiss, a bastion of control in the face of the unknown, brought up the rear, her rapier glinting like an icy shard in the harsh sunlight.

The air thrummed with the aftermath of violence.  The closer they got, the more gruesome the details became.  Scorch marks, black and angry, marred the skiff’s hull like grotesque tattoos, testament to some terrible inferno.  Massive gashes, deep enough to bury a hand, scored the metal, the unmistakable signature of Grimm claws.  Ruby’s stomach twisted.  The raw, metallic tang of blood, faint but undeniable, mingled with the ever-present dust and sand, assaulting her nostrils.  _Someone fought here.  Hard._

Scattered cargo littered the sand, a macabre still life.  Crates of Dust, some cracked and leaking a sickly rainbow of energy, lay haphazardly amongst trampled medical supplies.  Personal effects – a tattered book, a dented canteen, a child’s worn doll – were scattered like fallen leaves, each a silent scream of interrupted lives.  The unreality that had clung to Ruby since their return began to recede, replaced by a grim acceptance.  _This is real.  This is happening._

Weiss knelt beside a particularly deep gash, her fingers tracing the ragged edges. The metallic chill seeped through her gloves, a stark reminder of the violence unleashed here. “Sabyr,” she murmured, her voice tight with controlled emotion.  “Judging by the depth and width of these marks, I'd wager a large one.  Perhaps even an Alpha.”  The very thought sent a shiver down her spine.  _Control, Weiss.  Maintain control._

Blake, crouched low to the ground, sifted the sand through her fingers.  Her Faunus senses, acutely attuned to the nuances of the desert, painted a grim picture.  The swirling patterns in the sand told a tale of chaotic struggle.  Human footprints, mingled with the larger, clawed imprints of the Grimm, spoke of a desperate fight for survival.  But there were no drag marks, no sign of bodies being carried away.  _Where are they?_ The question clawed at her, a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest.

Yang, her fists clenched, paced restlessly, a predator on high alert.  Her gaze swept the dunes, searching for any flicker of movement, any hint of returning danger.  The frustration of their helplessness gnawed at her.  _If I had been here…_ The thought was quickly suppressed, replaced by a fierce protectiveness for her team.  _I won't let anything happen to them._

Jaune, his usual exuberance muted, moved with a quiet intensity.  He said little, but his eyes missed nothing.  He observed the scorch marks, the scattered debris, the subtle tracks in the sand, absorbing every detail.  Beneath his stoic exterior, his mind raced.  _Think, Jaune.  What would Pyrrha do?_  The familiar pang of grief struck him, but this time, it was different.  It wasn't a crippling wave, but a steady undercurrent, a source of strength rather than despair.

They reached the cockpit door, a twisted, gaping maw in the skiff's side.  The metal groaned ominously under the weight of the sand pressing against it.  The air inside felt thick, stagnant, pregnant with the unknown.  They exchanged a look, a silent acknowledgment of the shared decision.  It was time to find out what lay within.
