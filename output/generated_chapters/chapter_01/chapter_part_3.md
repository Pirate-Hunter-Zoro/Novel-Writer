The glint solidified into a promise, a tangible point of focus in the hallucinatory shimmer of the Vacuan heat. A silent, shared consensus rippled through the group. They had a destination.

Instinct, honed by years of trial and forged in the crucible of loss, took over. They fell into formation without a word, a familiar constellation against the hostile, alien sky. Ruby took the point, her red hood a defiant slash of color against the endless ochre. The oppressive weight of gravity, a forgotten torment in the Ever After, now felt like an anchor, each step a conscious, deliberate act of planting herself back on Remnant. The fine, pale sand sifted into the seams of her boots, a constant, abrasive reminder. *One foot in front of the other. That’s all. Just like always.* It was a simple mantra, a lifeline against the disorienting unreality that still clung to the edges of her perception.

Flanking her, Weiss and Blake moved with a starkly contrasting grace. Weiss’s steps were precise, economical, her white coat already seeming to repel the worst of the dust. She held herself with a rigid composure that was a sheer act of will. The dry, scorching air was an offense, a chaotic variable she couldn’t control, and it grated on her every nerve. Her mind, sharp and analytical, fought to catalogue the sensations—the prickling heat on her skin, the way the light reflected off the silica, the low moan of the wind—all while wrestling the urge to simply freeze it all into a more orderly, crystalline state. *Control, Schnee. Discipline.* The return of her physical form was a double-edged sword; the familiar aches were a grounding reality, but the vulnerability, the sheer, breakable humanity of it all after her time as a miniature doll, was a fresh and unnerving terror.

Blake, on the other hand, seemed to flow over the dunes. Her Faunus senses, dulled and distorted in the nonsensical Ever After, were now screaming with input. The wind carried a thousand smells: the sterile ozone of spent lightning Dust, the acrid tang of burned metal, the faint, sweet-sickly scent of something organic baking in the sun. Every whisper of moving sand, every distant skittering sound beneath the surface, registered in her sensitive ears. Her concern for her team was a low, constant thrum beneath her cautious exterior. They were all so exposed here. She scanned the ground, her amber eyes narrowed, already trying to decipher the story written in the disturbed patterns of the sand, her body a paradigm of coiled potential.

Bringing up the rear, Jaune and Yang were a study in contrasts. Jaune moved with a heavy, measured tread, his newfound maturity settled onto his shoulders like a well-worn mantle. The sun beat down on his armor, but he seemed not to notice, his gaze distant. He was a vessel of quiet endurance, the vast, empty desert a mirror to the lonely eons he’d weathered in his heart. The dull ache in his joints, the solid heft of Crocea Mors on his hip—these were not discomforts, but proofs. Proof that he was real, that this was real, that the long, lonely dream was finally over. The grief for Penny, for everything, was still there, a hollow space in his chest, but it was a part of him now, integrated and accepted.

Yang was a different beast entirely. She was pure, kinetic energy held barely in check, a sentinel radiating visceral frustration. The heat didn't just press down on her; it seemed to fuel the furnace of her own internal rage. *First the Fall, then the Ever After, now this? Can’t we just get a minute?* Her prosthetic arm felt dense, a solid weight of complex machinery that hummed with latent power. Her gaze was a physical force, sweeping relentlessly across the ridgelines, her sharp, **gold-amber** eyes missing nothing. Every flicker of heat haze was a potential enemy, every gust of wind a possible attack. Her protective instinct, raw and incandescent, was focused laser-tight on the small group moving ahead of her, especially on the slight figure in the red hood.

As they crested the final dune, the full scene of devastation unfurled below them. It was a transport skiff, its hull plated with the dun-colored insignia of Shade Academy, half-swallowed by the sand. It looked like a great metal beast that had been mauled and left for dead. The silence that followed the howling wind was profound, broken only by their own ragged breathing.

Yang broke off first, her boots digging into the loose sand as she scrambled up a neighboring dune to establish an overwatch position. From her vantage point, she could see the full extent of the chaos. “Area’s clear,” she called down, her voice tight, “for now.”

The others began their slow, forensic descent into the crash site. The air grew thick with the smell of leaked coolant and spilled Dust. Weiss was the first to touch the wounded vessel, her gloved fingers tracing the edge of a massive, gouged rent in the armor plating. The metal was peeled back like flesh, the edges blackened and scorched.

“The scorch marks are consistent with plasma discharge,” she murmured, her mind a whirlwind of data and schematics. She moved further along the hull, examining a set of three deep, parallel claw marks that had carved through the armor as if it were clay. “The size and spacing of the claw gashes… the depth of the penetration… it’s not a Death Stalker. Something bigger. Faster. Possibly a Greater Sand-Ray. They hunt skiffs in this sector, using plasma bursts to disable engines before they strike.” Her voice was clinical, a shield against the horror of the implication.

While Weiss analyzed the machine, Blake focused on the human element. She crouched low, letting sand run through her fingers. The ground was a canvas of terror. She could distinguish the heavy, dragging imprints of a massive Grimm from the frantic, overlapping footprints of the crew. “There were people here,” she said, her voice strained. “At least three, maybe four sets of tracks. They were fighting… retreating toward the cockpit.” She looked up, her expression grim. “But all the tracks end here. There are no footprints leading *away* from the wreckage.”

Ruby and Jaune moved through the scattered debris field. The violence of the Grimm’s attack was evident in the detritus. A heavy-duty cargo crate had been smashed open, its contents—vials of elemental Dust—spilling out in sparkling, inert piles, neutralized by the sand. A medkit had been ripped apart, its sterile bandages and injectors trampled into the grime. Ruby nudged a discarded personal datapad with the toe of her boot. Its screen was a spiderweb of cracks, frozen on a family photo. A knot of cold fury and renewed purpose tightened in her stomach. They weren't just Huntsmen; they were a shield for people like this, people with families waiting for them.

Jaune picked up a scorched piece of paneling, weighing it in his hand before letting it drop with a soft thud. He said nothing, his stoic silence a testament to a grief too deep for casual expression. He had seen too much death, too much loss, to be shocked. He was only weary, and sad.

They converged slowly, their individual findings creating a single, grim picture. They stood before the cockpit, its main door torn partially from its hinges, hanging at a drunken angle and revealing a sliver of the darkness within.

“Weiss?” Ruby asked, her voice low.

“A Greater Sand-Ray,” Weiss confirmed, her gaze fixed on the breached door. “It disabled them, then tore the ship apart to get to the crew.”

“And Blake?”

“They never made it out,” Blake answered softly, her eyes full of a sorrowful certainty.

Yang slid down the dune to rejoin them, her shotgun gauntlets clicking as she flexed her fists. Her golden eyes met Ruby’s, a silent question passing between them. The exterior told a story of a battle lost. The fate of the crew, however, was still a mystery locked inside that dark, silent space.

Ruby took a deep breath, the dusty air filling her lungs. She looked at each of her teammates, at the faces of her family, battered but unbroken. The unreality of the Ever After was gone, burned away by the Vacuan sun and the hard, terrible clarity of their duty. She gave a single, decisive nod toward the cockpit. “Let’s find out what happened to them.”
