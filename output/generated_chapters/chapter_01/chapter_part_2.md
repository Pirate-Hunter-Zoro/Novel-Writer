**(Section 1-B: The Discovery)**

The world swam back into focus, a brutal re-entry into the realm of the tangible.  The initial, paralyzing disorientation began to recede, replaced by the icy grip of reality.  Gravity, a forgotten burden, pressed down on them, each breath a conscious effort against the leaden weight in their chests. Ruby swayed, her vision still speckled with phantom colors, the echoes of Ever After clinging to her like cobwebs.  Shaking her head, she forced herself to focus. *Think, Ruby, think.*  They needed a plan. They needed… something.

"Everyone, status report!" Her voice, though strained, carried a newfound steel, the weight of leadership settling heavily on her young shoulders.

Weiss, pale but composed, ran a gloved hand over her arm, as if confirming its solidity. "Physically, I believe we're… intact. Though this heat is atrocious." Her eyes, sharp and assessing, scanned the undulating landscape.  *Control yourself, Weiss. Panic solves nothing.* She suppressed a shudder, the memory of their ethereal prison still clinging to her like a phantom limb.

Blake, ever alert, stood poised, her feline ears twitching, picking up the subtle whispers of the desert wind. The return of her Faunus senses after the muted stillness of the Ever After was almost overwhelming. The gritty sting of sand against her skin, the sun's scorching kiss on her fur, the low, mournful moan of the wind – it was a cacophony after the silence.  *Something's…off.*  A faint, rhythmic groan, barely audible beneath the wind's howl, pricked at her ears.  Metal. Stressed metal. A sound alien to this barren landscape.

Yang, her fists clenched, paced restlessly, her aura flickering erratically.  Frustration radiated off her like heat waves.  *Damn it, damn it, damn it.*  Her muscles ached, her semblance felt sluggish, and this blasted desert sun was doing nothing to improve her mood.  She longed to unleash her energy, to *do* something, anything, to break this oppressive stillness.

Jaune, his face etched with a quiet stoicism, took in the scene. He felt strangely…calm. The Ever After, while terrifying, had stripped away a layer of his youthful naiveté, leaving behind a core of steely resolve.  He drew a slow, steadying breath. *Think. Observe. Lead.* He pointed towards the hazy horizon. "We need to find shelter, water, anything. Fan out, but stay within shouting distance. Ruby, with me."

The group began to move, each step a conscious effort against the unfamiliar gravity.  The sand, scorching beneath their boots, shifted and whispered with every footfall.  The air shimmered, distorting the already desolate landscape.  The wind howled, a mournful dirge that seemed to echo the emptiness of their surroundings.

Ruby, her semblance still sluggish, felt the lingering unreality of the Ever After pulling at her.  *This is real, this is happening.* She focused on the task at hand, scanning the horizon with weary eyes.

Weiss, her internal monologue a constant battle against panic, meticulously analyzed the terrain, searching for any sign of civilization, any anomaly in the desolate expanse. She shielded her eyes against the glare, forcing herself to focus despite the shimmering heat haze that danced before her vision.

Blake, her senses now fully engaged, strained to pinpoint the source of the metallic groan.  It was faint, intermittent, carried on the capricious whims of the wind.  *There.* She turned her head slightly, focusing on a point just beyond the horizon, her ears twitching, catching the rhythmic pulse beneath the wind’s lament.

Yang, her frustration simmering just beneath the surface, kicked at a loose rock, sending it skittering across the sand. *This is useless! We’re never going to find anything in this wasteland.*  She closed her eyes for a moment, trying to rein in her restless energy.

Jaune, his gaze sweeping the horizon, felt a pang of grief for Pyrrha, a phantom ache in his chest. *We’ll make it back, Pyrrha. I promise.* He focused on the present, on the task at hand.

Then, as Weiss shielded her eyes against another blinding gust of wind-blown sand, she saw it.  A fleeting glint of light, unnatural and sharp, piercing through the shimmering heat haze.  A reflection off something smooth, something…metallic. Something that did not belong in this desolate expanse of rock and sand.

"There!" Weiss pointed, her voice sharp with sudden urgency.

All eyes turned towards the point she indicated, a shared focus snapping into place in the vast emptiness.  A target.  Hope, fragile but potent, flickered in the desolate landscape.
