The unreality of it was a film clinging to Ruby’s eyes, distorting the world into a wavering, overexposed photograph. The initial, paralyzing shock—a static roar that had consumed all thought—was finally receding, leaving behind the thrumming engine of a thousand frantic questions. This wasn't the Ever After. That much was a certainty hammered home by the sheer, oppressive weight of her own body. Gravity, a forgotten tyrant, reclaimed its due, pulling at the unfamiliar set of her shoulders and the leaden ache in her bones. She could feel the grit of sand working its way into the seams of her boots, an abrasive, terrestrial annoyance that was almost comforting in its familiarity. Almost.

*It’s real. This is real.* The thought was a mantra, a desperate anchor against the lingering sensation of fiction. *So what now? What do I do now?* The faces of her team swam in her peripheral vision, blurred by the shimmering air. They were looking to her. Of course, they were. The weight of their trust felt heavier than the sun on her back. She swallowed, her throat a desert in miniature. The resolve was there, a flickering ember she had to coax back into a flame. “Okay,” she said, the sound a ragged croak stolen by the incessant wind. “Okay, everyone… spread out. Eyes on the horizon. Tell me what you see.”

Jaune was already moving, his silence a stark contrast to the storm of sensation. He didn’t offer platitudes or reassurances; he simply acted, his movements economical and sure. This was the new Jaune, the one forged in isolation and tempered by a grief so profound it seemed to have become part of his molecular structure. He felt the sun bake the back of his neck, the searing heat a punishment he accepted without complaint. It was real. Unlike the painted sky of the Ever After, this pain was an honest broker. His armor felt strange, the plates settling in ways they hadn’t before, as if the memory of his older, rusted form lingered beneath the polished steel. He scanned the horizon, his gaze sweeping methodically from left to right, not searching for hope, but for a fact. Any fact. A rock formation, a dead tree, a change in the endless, undulating dunes of ochre sand. Something to prove this wasn't just another, crueler illusion.

A flicker of white linen snapped in the wind beside him. Weiss. Her composure was a crystalline lattice, and Ruby could see the microscopic fractures spreading through it. Her knuckles were white where she gripped the hilt of Myrtenaster, not as a weapon, but as a grounding rod. Her mind, usually a fortress of logic and sharp observation, was a maelstrom. *Control it, Schnee. Analyze. Don’t feel.* But the feeling was an inferno. The blinding light was an assault, the heat a physical force pushing against her, and the dust a violation, coating her tongue and eyelashes with a fine, gritty paste. Every ragged breath was a testament to her loss of control. She blinked, trying to pierce the heat haze that made the distant dunes dance and mock her. There was nothing. Less than nothing. An emptiness so absolute it felt like a presence in itself. It was the antithesis of everything she was: order, grace, purpose. And it was terrifying.

“Getting a whole lot of nothing over here!” Yang’s voice was a frustrated roar, almost lost to the wind’s howl. She kicked at a drift of sand, the motion born of a furious, burning energy that had nowhere to go. Her prosthetic arm felt oddly numb, the advanced sensors struggling to parse the oppressive, uniform heat. Every fiber of her being screamed for a target, an enemy, something to punch. This vast, indifferent landscape was a prison without walls, and it grated on her more than any cage ever could. Her protective instinct, a bonfire in her chest, blazed with agonizing impotence. Ruby was trying to take charge, Jaune was being… whatever Jaune was now, Weiss was about to shatter, and Blake…

Blake was perfectly, unnaturally still. While the others squinted against the glare, her own focus was internal. The world, to her, was a cacophony. After the muted, dreamlike senses of the Ever After, Remnant was a physical blow. The sun didn't just warm her skin; it sizzled against her sensitive ears. The wind wasn't just a sound; it was a physical scouring, each grain of sand a tiny needle against her face. Her concern for her team was a tight knot in her stomach; she could feel their anxiety as if it were a scent on the air. She tried to filter the noise, to find a pattern in the chaos. The wind howled, yes, a deep and mournful cry across the dunes. But beneath it… under it… something else. Something that didn't belong.

At first, it was indistinguishable from the gale, a ghost of a vibration. But it was rhythmic. It was consistent. She tilted her head, her dark ears twitching, rotating to isolate the frequency from the roar of the wind. There. A low, cyclical groan. A wounded sound. The noise of metal, stressed and complaining under a relentless, repeating strain. It wasn't the sound of rock, or sand, or any living thing. It was the sound of a machine in pain.

"Blake?" Yang’s voice cut through her concentration, sharp with worry. "You okay? You look like you're a million miles away."

Blake didn't turn. Her entire being was now a conduit for this one, impossible sound. She raised a hand, not for silence, but to help herself focus. The others fell quiet, their own scans forgotten as they turned to her. The wind whipped her hair across her face, but her golden eyes were fixed on a point in the shimmering distance, a point where there was nothing to see.

"Listen," she breathed, her voice barely a whisper, yet it carried with an undeniable urgency. "Do you hear that?"
