### **Prompt 1-D: The Cockpit and the Climax**

**Objective:** Continuing *immediately* from the end of the previous section, this part focuses on the tense investigation of the skiff's interior, leading to the chapter's central, chilling discovery.

**[Begin Section 1-D]**

**(Use the full text from Sections 1-A, 1-B, and 1-C as the preceding context.)**

The team breaches the cockpit. The atmosphere inside should be tense and claustrophobic, a stark contrast to the open desert. Describe the signs of a desperate, final struggle within the confined space—dents in the console, a discarded weapon, maybe a tear in a seat.

This entire section builds to the chapter's mini-climax. After a few moments of searching, they find something that makes the abstract threat of their return horrifyingly real and immediate.

* **Path A (The Datapad):** Tucked under a seat or still clutched in a dislodged pilot's gauntlet, they find a datapad. Its screen is cracked but still functional. It displays a single, chilling, unfinished emergency transmission: "They're here... Sky is falling... Grimm are not... not like before... request immedi—" The message cuts out.
* **Path B (The Grimm):** A noise from a shadowed corner of the cockpit reveals a single, grievously wounded Beowolf, trapped and dying from the crash. It is mangled and pathetic, but still dangerous. It langes one last time, forcing a swift, brutal, and personal execution that solidifies their return to war.

**WARNING: CRITICAL PACING DIRECTIVE IN EFFECT. MAINTAIN DEEP INTERNAL MONOLOGUE AND SENSORY DETAIL UNTIL THE VERY END. DO NOT CONCLUDE OR SUMMARIZE THE SCENE. SHOW, DO NOT TELL.**
---

**Crucial Ending Point:** This section must end at the absolute peak of the climax: the moment they read the final word of the message and its implication sinks in, OR the moment the final deathblow is dealt to the wounded Grimm.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** A tight, claustrophobic shot from inside the dark cockpit. The only light comes from a cracked datapad screen held by Jaune, illuminating his and Ruby's horrified faces as they read the ominous, unfinished message.

**[End Section 1-D]**
