The silence stretched, taut and heavy, broken only by the whisper of wind across the sand. The adrenaline that had propelled them through the desert, through the fight, through the discovery, now drained away, leaving a chilling emptiness in its wake.  Ruby lowered the datapad, its fractured screen reflecting the stark fear in her silver eyes.  The words, though few, echoed in her mind: *They’re here… Sky is falling… not like before…*

Weiss, her face pale, stepped back from the console, her hand unconsciously moving to brush dust from her pristine white jacket.  The gesture, usually a sign of fastidiousness, now seemed a fragile attempt to restore order in a world suddenly tilting on its axis.  Yang, her usual boisterous energy extinguished, placed a heavy hand on Blake’s shoulder, a silent offering of strength.  Blake, her feline eyes narrowed, stared at the bloodstained gauntlet still gripping the yoke, her usual stoicism replaced by a flicker of raw vulnerability.  Jaune, his youthful face etched with a newfound gravity, said nothing. He simply turned away from the carnage within the cockpit, his gaze sweeping the vast expanse of the Vacuan desert with a strategic weight that belied his age.

No one spoke. There was no need. The fragmented message, the slain Grimm, the oppressive silence of the desert—it all coalesced into a single, grim understanding.  They weren’t just survivors anymore.  They were soldiers, returned to a war they hadn’t realized they were still fighting, a war that had changed, grown more dangerous, more desperate.  Ruby’s hands, still clutching the datapad, clenched tighter, the faint tremor replaced by steely resolve.  The light in her eyes, dimmed momentarily by fear, hardened into a determined glint.

They filed out of the wrecked skiff, one by one, stepping back into the blinding sunlight. The desert, once a symbol of their escape, now seemed to stretch before them like a hungry beast, its vast emptiness concealing untold dangers. The wind whipped around them, carrying the scent of sand and something else, something ancient and malevolent. They stood together before the wreckage, five figures silhouetted against the harsh Vacuan sun, their faces grim, their shoulders set, their eyes fixed on the horizon. The Ever After hadn't saved them. It had brought them back to a nightmare.

The hunt was on.
