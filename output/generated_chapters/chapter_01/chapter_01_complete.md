**(Path A)**

The silence in the wrecked skiff pressed down on them, heavier than the desert air outside. Ruby’s fingers tightened around Crescent Rose, the cool metal a stark contrast to the burning fear that coiled in her gut.  "Not like before…" she echoed, the fragmented message a chilling prophecy.  What could be worse than the Grimm they already knew?

Jaune carefully placed the datapad back on the floor, the shattered screen a reflection of their fractured hope.  He didn’t need to voice his fears; they were mirrored in Weiss's pale face and the grim set of Yang's jaw.  Blake simply stared at the message, her violet eyes dark with a chilling understanding.  The world had shifted, not with a bang, but with a whispered warning.

They stepped out of the skiff, blinking against the harsh Vacuan sun. The desert, once a symbol of their escape, now seemed a vast, unforgiving arena.  The wind whispered through the wreckage, a mournful dirge for a world they no longer recognized.

**(Path B)**

The Beowolf’s lifeless eyes stared up at them, a stark reminder of the brutal reality they had returned to.  Ruby’s hand trembled slightly as she retracted Crescent Rose, the weight of the Grimm’s life, however brief, a tangible burden. The metallic scent of blood mingled with the desert air, a grim perfume clinging to them.

No one spoke.  The echoes of the Beowolf’s final roar still reverberated in the suffocating silence.  Jaune’s gaze drifted to the horizon, no longer searching for rescue, but assessing the landscape with a soldier's eye.  Yang placed a hand on Blake’s shoulder, a silent gesture of comfort and shared understanding. The weight of their shared experience pressed down on them, forging a bond stronger than words.

They emerged from the wreckage, the blinding sun a stark contrast to the shadows they carried within.  The desert stretched before them, no longer empty, but teeming with unseen threats. The wind whipped across the sand, a prelude to the storm they knew was coming.


**(Both Paths Converge)**

The five of them stood before the wreckage, silhouetted against the endless expanse of Vacuo.  The desert, once a symbol of freedom, now felt like a prison. The sun beat down on them, merciless and unforgiving. They were no longer running; they were preparing.  The war had found them.

The wind carried a single, desolate howl across the dunes, a chilling reminder that they were not alone.  They were home, and the fight for Remnant had just begun.
