The return was not a gentle awakening. It was a cataclysm.

One moment, there was the saccharine, storybook unreality of the Ever After—a world of talking animals and existential flora. The next, there was only violence. A bone-shattering shriek of tearing metal, a concussive blast of displaced air, and then the overwhelming, omnidirectional assault of a world that had forgotten them.

For Weiss, the first sensation was weight. The weight was a betrayal, a crushing hand slamming her back into a reality she had almost forgotten, where bones were brittle things and flight was a memory stolen by the unforgiving pull of the world. As a bird, she had been air and instinct. Now, sprawled on her side, she was merely flesh and aching joints. A brutal anchor.

*Gravity,* her mind supplied, the thought a shard of ice in a furnace. *This is gravity.*

The heat followed, a physical blow that sucked the moisture from her lungs and turned the air to fire. It was nothing like the temperate climates of Atlas or the mild warmth of Vale. This was a hostile, living heat that pressed in from all sides, radiating from a sky the color of a bleached-out sapphire and from the ground beneath her—a shifting, abrasive sea of pale sand. The light was its accomplice, a white, vitreous glare so absolute it felt as though the sun had detonated inches from her face, burning away all color and shadow. She squeezed her eyes shut, but the intensity seared through her eyelids, painting the inside of her vision a throbbing, painful red.

*Assess. Survive. Logic.* The old Schnee training kicked in, a desperate mantra against the sensory cacophony. She forced one eye open a crack. The world swam in a haze of shimmering heat, the horizon a distorted, liquid mercury line. The air was thick with a fine, gritty dust that coated her tongue like powdered glass and stung her eyes. It was everywhere, a pale ghost clinging to her white jacket, already staining it a miserable beige. The irony was a bitter pill—the Schnee Dust Company heiress, brought low by common, useless dust.

A few yards away, a figure stirred. Black hair, a tattered yellow ribbon. Blake.

Blake’s return was a symphony of torment for her heightened senses. The howling wind was not just a sound; it was a physical scouring, a high-pitched scream that carried millions of tiny, sharp-edged particles of sand. It flayed the exposed skin of her face and hands, and the noise drilled into her sensitive Faunus ears, a dentist’s drill against raw nerve. She pressed her palms over them, but it was useless. The sound was inside her skull.

The heat was a predator. It beat down on her dark hair and clothing, a suffocating blanket woven from static and fire. She could feel the sun baking her skin, drawing the life out of her. In the Ever After, her form had been fluid, a reflection of need. Here, she was trapped in a body that felt alienly vulnerable. Her lungs burned with every breath of superheated air. The world smelled of baked rock, ozone, and a profound, desolate emptiness.

Her gaze found Yang, a splash of violent gold against the monochrome wasteland. Yang was on one knee, her prosthetic arm planted in the sand, knuckles down, as if to physically defy the planet’s attempt to swallow them. Concern, sharp and clear, cut through Blake’s own misery. *Yang. Is she…*

Yang felt the world as a challenge. The heat was a furnace, and she was the anvil. Every inch of her skin prickled, slick with a sweat that evaporated almost as soon as it formed, leaving a salty crust behind. Her lilac eyes, narrowed to slits against the glare, scanned their surroundings. Wreckage. Twisted, groaning metal—the remains of whatever vessel had ferried them here—formed a broken crescent around them. Beyond it, nothing. Dunes rolled into infinity, their crests whipped into fine plumes by the incessant wind.

Her prosthetic felt… solid. Heavier than she remembered. In the Ever After, it had been a part of her narrative, an extension of her will. Here, it was a complex machine of metal and circuits, its weight a familiar, grounding presence. She flexed the fingers, the whir of servos a small, reassuring sound against the wind’s shriek. The phantom ache in her shoulder, a ghost that had haunted her for years, was blessedly absent, replaced by the solid, definitive reality of the arm. She was whole. But the world was broken.

“Blake!” Her voice was a raw croak, torn from a throat lined with sand. She pushed to her feet, legs trembling with the effort. Each step was a battle, the sand sucking at her boots, trying to drag her down. She reached Blake, her shadow a meager patch of relief in the blinding sun. “You okay?”

Blake nodded, though the gesture was stiff, her face pale beneath its dusting of sand. “Overwhelmed,” she managed, her own voice barely a whisper. The simple act of speaking felt like swallowing hot coals.

Then Yang saw him. Jaune.

He was on his hands and knees, head bowed, his blond hair—no longer streaked with the grey of age—caked with dust. He wasn’t looking at the sky or the wreckage. He was staring at his own hands.

For Jaune Arc, the transition was the cruelest of miracles. One moment, he was the Rusted Knight, his body a roadmap of decades of sorrow and solitude, his joints a chorus of ossified aches. The next… the aches were gone. The deep-set lines on his face, the weariness that had settled into his very marrow—vanished. He was young again. The skin on his hands was smooth, the muscles in his arms coiled with a forgotten potency. But it felt wrong. It felt like a theft.

His mind was a maelstrom of temporal dissonance. The memories of his long, lonely years—the faces of the Paper Pleasers, the taste of rust and regret, the endless waiting—were still crystal clear, sharp-edged and painful. But they were housed in a body that had no right to them. He felt like a ghost haunting his own youth, a man out of time in his own skin. The weight of Crocea Mors, lying beside him, felt… light. Too light for the old man he had been. He ran a trembling hand over his face, expecting the familiar scrape of a beard, and met only smooth, strange skin. A wave of vertigo washed over him, so profound he thought he might vomit. *Who am I?* The question was not philosophical; it was a genuine, terrifying inquiry.

And then there was Ruby.

She hadn't moved. She lay on her back, one arm flung over her eyes, the other resting on the cool, unforgiving steel of Crescent Rose. She was a slash of red and black against the pale canvas of the desert, unnervingly still. The heat, the wind, the noise—they seemed to wash over her, not touching the core of her stillness.

Inside, however, she was drowning. The physical sensations were distant, muted echoes. The real assault was internal. The return to her own body was a brutal eviction from the strange peace she’d found in being… other. Being "just Ruby" again felt like putting on a suit of armor that was too tight, its edges digging into wounds she hadn't known were still there. The lightness she'd felt, the shedding of a burden she couldn't name, was gone. In its place was the crushing weight of leadership, of expectation, of her own monumental failures.

Her breath hitched, a ragged, painful sound. Her fingers tightened on her scythe. It was the only thing that felt real. Its familiar weight, the worn grip, the perfect balance—it was an anchor in the swirling chaos of her soul. *You chose this,* a voice whispered in her mind, the voice of the Blacksmith, of the tree, of herself. *You chose to be Ruby Rose.* But the choice, made in a world of metaphor, felt like a curse in this world of punishing reality. The heat on her skin was judgment. The sand in her throat was penance.

Slowly, shakily, Yang helped Blake to her feet. Weiss, her composure a fractured but functional shield, rose as well, her hand instinctively going to the hilt of Myrtenaster. Jaune pushed himself upright, his movements unsteady, like a fawn on new legs, his eyes lost and haunted.

One by one, they converged on the largest piece of wreckage—a skeletal metal ribcage that offered a sliver of shade. They huddled together, a small, battered island of humanity in a vast, indifferent ocean of sand. No one spoke. There were no words for this. There was only the howl of the wind, the sting of the sand, and the shared, ragged sound of their breathing, each gasp a fight against the hostile, alien air of Vacuo. They were back. They were together. And they were utterly, terrifyingly alone.

Here is the narrative section, written according to your prompt and directives.

***

The sun over Vacuo was not a benevolent star; it was a malignant eye in a bleached, unforgiving sky. Its glare hammered down, turning the air into a shimmering, liquid distortion that warped the endless dunes into a rippling, ochre sea. The world was two colors: the searing white of the sky and the burnt orange of the sand. There was no third.

For Ruby Rose, the return to her own body was a brutal reunion. Gravity, an abstract concept in the whimsical physics of the Ever After, was now a physical chain. Each step was a conscious effort, her boots sinking into the granular torment of the sand with a soft, soul-sucking sigh. Crescent Rose, slung across her back, felt less like an extension of herself and more like a slab of penance, its familiar weight now an alien burden. She remembered being small, a creature of wood and cloth, and a phantom memory of that weightlessness made the current reality a thousand times heavier.

*One foot. Then the other,* she told herself, the thought a frayed rope in the maelstrom of her mind. *Just like before. Simple.* But it wasn’t simple. The air she dragged into her lungs was not air; it was a furnace breath, thick with a fine, silicate silt that coated her tongue and scoured her throat raw. Every exhalation was a gasp, a plume of dust and desperation. She could feel the sun baking the metal of her weapon through her cloak, a persistent, warning heat against her spine. The world smelled of baked rock and nothingness. This was real. The ache in her arches, the sting of sweat in her eyes, the burn in her muscles—this was the price of reality, and it was excruciatingly high.

A few paces to her left, Weiss Schnee moved like a ghost haunting her own body. In the Ever After, she had been remade, almost porcelain. Now, that memory made her feel breakable. Her immaculate white coat was a ruin of dust and sweat, clinging to her with a damp, suffocating intimacy. She could feel the grit inside her boots, a constant, abrasive presence that was rubbing her ankles raw. Worse was the grit between her teeth, a fine grinding she couldn't escape.

*This is… undignified,* a part of her mind, the part that was still a Schnee heiress, hissed with venomous futility. *This is barbarism.* But the thought was hollow, swallowed by the sheer, overwhelming misery of her physical state. Her body, once an instrument of precise, elegant power, now felt like borrowed, ill-fitting clay. Every joint screamed a silent protest against the oppressive heat and the monotonous, yielding terrain. She lifted a hand to shield her eyes, the motion lethargic, her skin filmed with a grimy sheen. The light was a physical assault, so absolute and shadowless that it stole all depth from the landscape, making it impossible to judge distance. Was that mountain a day’s walk away, or a week’s? The thought spiraled into a dizzying eddy of despair. She was no longer a Huntress, a master of Glyphs and Dust. She was just a collection of aches, held together by a fraying will.

Blake Belladonna endured. Of the four, she was the most accustomed to the quiet hardship of the wild, but even this tested the limits of her stoicism. The wind, a constant, howling presence, was the worst for her. It was a physical entity, a sand-fanged maw that scoured and scraped at every exposed surface, and it carried the desert’s dolorous song directly into her sensitive ears. Where once they would have twitched at the whisper of a footstep from a hundred yards, they now felt clogged, overwhelmed by the ceaseless, abrasive roar.

She walked with a steady, energy-conserving gait, her eyes narrowed to slits against the particulate haze. Her return to physicality was a strange paradox. A phantom lightness still clung to her limbs, a memory of pouncing on paws of felt and thread, of a purr that was not just a sound but an all-encompassing vibration. Now, her human form felt dense, clumsy. The sun beat down on her dark hair, and she could feel the heat radiating through her skull, a dull, pounding headache that was the metronome to their miserable march. She focused on the rhythm of her breathing, trying to filter the dust, trying to find a center in the vast, hostile emptiness.

“See anything?” Yang Xiao Long’s voice was a hoarse crackle, the words scraped from a parched throat. She walked beside Blake, a bulwark of simmering frustration against the elements.

Blake shook her head, not trusting her own voice. “Nothing but more of this.”

For Yang, the heat was a personal affront. It leeched her strength, a constant drain that her Semblance, which thrived on damage, could do nothing to combat. This wasn't a blow she could absorb and return. It was an insidious, relentless siege. Her prosthetic arm was a particular torture. The metal, normally cool to the touch, now felt less like a part of her and more like a branding iron had been fused to her shoulder. She could feel the heat seeping through the internal mechanisms, a deep, pervasive warmth that promised a burn if it got any worse. She had taken to wrapping it in a spare strip of cloth, a flimsy defense that was already saturated with sweat.

Her gaze, a startling lilac in the monochrome world, was fixed on Ruby’s back. Every time her sister stumbled, a spike of cold, sharp fear lanced through Yang’s exhaustion. She saw not the capable leader of Team RWBY, but the fragile, shattered girl who had chosen to drink the tea. The memory was a fresh wound, and this desert was salt in it. *Keep her moving. Keep her safe.* The mantra was all she had left. Every muscle fiber in her body hummed with a low, desperate thrum—the need to hit something, to fight, to unleash the fury that this helplessness was breeding within her. But there was nothing to punch but the shimmering air.

It was Blake who stopped first. She froze mid-stride, her head tilted, her dust-caked cat ears finally catching something other than the wind’s lament. It was a faint, rhythmic sound, almost lost in the gale—a mournful, metallic clang.

“Wait,” she rasped, her voice thin but sharp.

Yang immediately came to a halt, her hand instinctively going to the hilt of her gauntlet. Weiss stumbled to a stop behind her, breathing heavily. Ruby turned slowly, her silver eyes clouded with fatigue, but now sharpened with a flicker of alarm. “What is it?”

“Listen,” Blake commanded, her own eyes scanning the horizon, trying to pierce the blinding light.

They all fell silent, straining to hear. And then they caught it—a hollow, intermittent *clang… clang… clang…* Carried on the wind. It was the sound of something metal striking metal, moved not by a hand, but by the indifferent gusts of wind.

“That way,” Blake pointed towards a high, sweeping dune to their right.

With a renewed, if grim, sense of purpose, they altered their course. The climb was agonizing. The loose sand gave way under their feet, stealing two steps for every three they took. Their lungs burned with the effort, the world narrowing to the next foothold, the next ragged breath.

Ruby was the first to crest the summit. She dropped to one knee, panting, and then her breath caught in her throat. Below them, nestled in a shallow basin, lay the corpse of a settlement. It wasn’t ancient ruins; the skeletons of the buildings were raw, the wounds fresh. Scorched timber reached for the sky like skeletal fingers. The hollow eyes of shattered windows stared out into the wasteland. What might have been a marketplace was a field of debris and charred carts. The source of the sound became clear: a metal sign, half-torn from its post, swinging in the wind and striking the metal pole with a desolate, rhythmic chime. It was the town’s death knell.

But it was the road leading away from the destruction that solidified the horror. It was littered with the detritus of a panicked exodus: a child’s toy, a dropped canteen, a tattered piece of Vacuan fabric snagged on a thorn-brush. There were no bodies, but the absence was somehow worse. This was not just a place that had been destroyed. This was a place that had been *emptied*. This was the consequence of Salem, of Atlas, of everything. It wasn't a story or a distant report. It was here, scarring the land in front of them, real and absolute. The heat, the thirst, the aching muscles—they were nothing. This was the true Vacuo. This was the despair.

---

The world returned with the subtlety of a body slam.

One moment, there was the placid un-reality of the Ever After—a kaleidoscope of impossible logic and dreamlike purpose. The next, there was pain. And heat. And gravity.

Gravity was the first true tormentor. It was a physical malevolence, a colossal hand pressing down on Jaune’s shoulders, spine, and soul. He gasped, the air a furnace blast that seared his lungs, and collapsed onto a dune of searing, rust-colored sand. His body, which for decades had carried the heavy, weary mantle of the Rusted Knight, was now jarringly young, a flimsy cage of aching bone and screaming muscle. He could feel the granular scrape of sand against his cheek, the sting of sweat in his eyes, the frantic, terrified thumping of a heart that felt too fast, too strong. The memory of his older, slower body—the phantom ache in joints that were no longer worn—made his current, lighter form an agony all its own.

A keening wind howled around him, a physical presence that scoured his skin and filled his ears with a desolate shriek. It lifted plumes of dust that tasted of ancient decay and stung his eyes. The sun was not a benevolent star but a malevolent god, a white-hot hammer pounding the anvil of the world, bleaching all color to a blinding, featureless glare. The air itself shimmered, a visible distortion that made the horizon dance and wobble like a fever dream.

*Get up,* his mind commanded, the voice of a leader who’d spent an eternity failing. *They need you.* But the order dissolved against the sheer, crushing weight of his reverted youth. He pushed a hand into the sand, the fine grains flowing through his fingers like liquid fire, and the simple act of leverage sent a jolt of agony through a wrist that felt unnervingly fragile.

A sound nearby, half-choke, half-sob, drew his attention. Weiss was on her knees a few feet away, her head bowed. Her long, white hair, usually a pristine banner, was matted with sweat and dirt. She was clutching her stomach, her breaths coming in ragged, shallow pants. In the Ever After, her mind had been a gilded cage, her reality warped and twisted by a puppeteer’s strings. She had known no certainty, no solid ground, no true north.

Her internal world was a cacophony of abhorrent sensations. The slosh of liquid in her gut. The grating of bone in its socket. The claustrophobic prison of her own skin felt real—too real—after the curated falsehoods she’d endured. She could feel every individual hair on her arms lifting in the hot wind, an unbearable, tickling friction. The blood pounding in her ears was a deafening drum against the memory of insidious, persuasive whispers. *This is wrong,* her thoughts screamed, a frantic spiral of revulsion. *This is too much. Too loud. I’m trapped again.* She squeezed her eyes shut, but the incandescent light still burned through her eyelids, painting the world in violent shades of red and orange.

Further off, Yang was a study in rigid fury. She was already on her feet, a defiance born of sheer, protective instinct. Her knuckles were white where she reflexively clenched her fist, the familiar weight of her prosthetic arm a cold, grounding shock. For her time in the Ever After, physics had been a suggestion. Now, a trickle of blood ran from a cut on her lip where she’d bitten it, and the salty, metallic taste was an infuriatingly real shock. She felt a scrape on her forearm from the fall, a raw, tender patch of skin that felt impossibly vulnerable.

She flexed her fingers, a tremor running through them. The softness of her own flesh was a liability. She remembered a world where falls were gentle, where consequence was negotiable. Now, she was a sack of fragile tissues and coursing fluids. A single misstep could shatter a bone, could spill her life onto this scorched earth. The thought was not just frightening; it was infuriating, a deep, cellular humiliation. She was a huntress, but she felt like glass, anticipating the crack. The wind, once a triviality, now felt like a thousand tiny needles, a constant reminder of how easily she and her family could be hurt. Her gaze was already locked on her sister.

It was Ruby’s quiet weeping that finally broke the spell of their individual hells.

She was the youngest, curled into a ball, her small frame shaking with uncontrolled tremors. In the Ever After, she had faced the abyss of herself and chosen to Ascend, to shed everything she was. She had been offered harmony—the peace of oblivion. Now, she was a symphony of discord.

"I can feel my own heartbeat," she whispered, her voice cracking, barely audible over the wind’s mournful song. "It's so... loud. It hurts."

Jaune forced himself to move. Every motion was a negotiation with pain. He crawled, dragging his protesting body across the few feet of sand that separated them, the heat radiating through his worn hoodie. He reached her, his hand hovering over her shaking shoulder, a sudden uncertainty gripping him. What comfort could he offer? He, the man who’d aged decades in isolation, felt just as lost as she did.

He let his hand rest on her back. The warmth of her, the fragile beat of life beneath his palm, was both a reassurance and a terror.

"I know, Ruby," he said, his voice a raw rasp. He had to swallow twice to get the words out, his throat caked with dust. "I know."

Yang was at her side in an instant, dropping to her knees with a grit of teeth. Her jaw was clenched, a muscle twitching in her cheek. "We're out. That's what matters," she bit out, but there was no conviction in it. It was the automatic response of a protector, a hollow mantra she didn't believe herself. She looked at her own hand, at the delicate network of veins beneath the skin. *Weak.*

Weiss lifted her head, her eyes—the color of a storm-wracked sea—glistening with unshed tears. "It's the gravity," she breathed, her voice airy and strange, as if still unmoored. "Gravity is a cruel anchor. It reminds you that you are bound to the dirt." She looked from Jaune's agonized posture to Yang's bristling anger. "That place... it wasn't real."

The admission hung in the shimmering air, a profound and terrible truth. They had been stripped of their complex, painful reality and given a different kind of existence. Now, being wholly themselves again felt like a punishment.

Jaune drew a shuddering breath, the hot air a trial. "I was old," he confessed, the words tasting like ash. "So old. I could feel the years in my bones, but I couldn't... ache like this." He looked at his own hands, calloused but unlined and trembling. "I'd forgotten what it was to feel breakable."

Yang finally let her shoulders slump, a fraction of her fighter’s façade crumbling. "I forgot how much everything could hurt," she said, her gaze fixed on the endless dunes. "The weight of it all." She touched the complex machinery of her own arm, then the cut on her lip, her finger coming away red. She stared at it, mesmerized by the proof of her own vulnerability.

Ruby’s sobs softened into quiet, hiccupping breaths. She uncurled slightly, leaning into Jaune's touch. "I almost wasn't anything," she whispered. "I didn't have to breathe."

The four of them remained there, a tableau of broken pilgrims marooned in a purgatorial wasteland. The wind howled on, indifferent. The sun beat down, merciless. They were raw, exposed, and flayed by the return to a world they had fought to save.

"We're not what we were," Jaune said, his voice gaining a sliver of its former strength, albeit aged with a weariness that didn't match his face. He wasn't speaking as a commander now, but as a fellow survivor. "The Ever After... it took something from us. And it left something behind." He looked at each of them, his gaze lingering—on Weiss's haunted eyes, Yang's newfound fragility, Ruby's terror. "But we're here. We are *here*."

He shifted, a grunt of pain escaping him, and moved to create a small huddle, urging the others closer with a gesture. Weiss crawled forward, her movements clumsy. Yang, after a long moment of hesitation, shuffled over, her pride warring with a desperate need for contact. They came together, a small, fragile circle against the vast, hostile emptiness. Their shoulders touched. Jaune’s aching arm went around Ruby; Weiss’s hand found Yang’s wrist, and she didn’t pull away.

"We'll carry this," Jaune murmured, the words for them alone, nearly stolen by the wind. "But we'll carry it together."

In the shelter of their small, human circle, the heat felt marginally less oppressive, the wind's shriek a little less personal. They were broken, yes. But they were no longer alone in their breaking.

---

The world returned not as a gentle dawn, but as a physical assault.

For Ruby, the first sensation was gravity. In the Ever After, especially after the Tree, her form had felt weightless, her mind boundless, a profound, quiet certainty that she was *enough*. She had soared on currents of pure acceptance. Now, gravity was a vindictive master, a brute force that slammed her into the scorched earth and held her there. Her shoulder blades, where the weight of leadership had so recently felt lifted, now screamed with a dull, grinding ache, a phantom pain for the peace she no longer possessed.

She pushed herself up, her palm sinking into sand that was not merely hot, but felt like a bed of dying embers. A gasp tore from her throat, a raw, ragged sound alien to the lightness she’d just known. The air she dragged into her lungs was a superheated particulate, thick with dust that coated her tongue and grated at the back of her throat. She blinked, and the light was a physical blow. A blinding, featureless white that bleached the world of colour and detail, leaving only the shimmering, distorted veil of heat rising from the ground in hallucinatory waves. The sun was not a benevolent star; it was a malevolent eye, a white-hot forge hanging in a bleached-blue sky, intent on rendering them to ash.

*Breathe,* she commanded herself, but the order was lost in the body’s desperate, instinctual panic. *Think. You are Ruby Rose. You led them here. You fell. But you came back. This… this is just heat. Just sand.*

But it wasn’t. It was the crushing reality of mortality. She could feel the thrumming of her own heart, a frantic, fleshy drumbeat in her ears. She could feel the slick, salty sting of sweat tracing paths of grime down her temples. These were sensations that felt terrifyingly crude after the clarity of Ascension.

Her gaze swept to the others. Weiss was curled into a tight ball, her face buried in her arms, her slight frame shuddering. Nearby, Blake was on her knees, hands pressed hard against her cat ears. The wind was another tormentor, a sculptor of miseries. It didn’t whisper; it shrieked, a high, keening wail that was pure agony for her faunus hearing, driving crystalline dust into every pore, every fold of cloth, a constant, abrasive torment. Yang was grimly pushing herself up, her metal arm already searing hot against her skin, a brutal reminder of old pains.

A few yards away, Jaune was on his hands and knees, head bowed as he coughed, a dry, hacking retch that produced nothing but a spray of dust. He spat, a thick, gritty motion of pure disgust.

For Weiss, the world was a vortex of sensory agony. The Ever After had been a place of cool, silvered moss underfoot, of air that tasted of sweet tea and possibility. Here, the world was an abrasive blanket of fire and grit. The sand wasn't just in her clothes; she could feel it between her teeth, under her eyelids, a thousand tiny needles scraping at the delicate membranes of her mortal body. Her skin, which had felt like her own again in that strange world, free from the porcelain artifice of her father's home, was now just… skin. Prickling, burning, vulnerable. A sob caught in her throat, hot and dry. The tears wouldn’t come. Her body didn’t have the moisture to spare.

*This is a punishment,* her mind whimpered. *We were cast out. Back into the clay. Back into the pain.* She could feel the pulse in her wrist, a frantic, animal rhythm. It felt so fragile, so temporary. A little bird trapped in a cage of bone, fluttering against its inevitable end.

Jaune, however, was already fighting back. The initial shock had hit him like a physical blow, the return to his younger body a claustrophobic nightmare. As the Rusted Knight, he had been a creature of weary resilience and iron will, his aged form a familiar shell. He could feel the ache in his bones before a storm. Now, his perception was slammed shut into this too-small, too-light prison of his own youth. He spat again, trying to clear the filth from his mouth. He forced his gaze to lift, squinting against the glare. The world was flat, hostile, and infuriatingly opaque.

*Analyze,* his mind snapped, a drill sergeant’s bark over the howl of the wind. *Complaint is a luxury. Observation is survival.* His eyes, sharper and more practiced than the others, began to dissect the horizon. Endless dunes, yes, but not without feature. To the west, the relentless waves of sand rose higher, coalescing into a long, jagged ridge of darker rock, its peaks distorted by the shimmering air. It looked like a broken spine jutting from the desert’s corpse.

Shelter. The word formed, clear and cold, in his mind.

“Ruby.”

His voice was a croak, almost stolen by the wind. He tried again, louder, forcing the sound from his raw throat. “Ruby!”

Ruby’s head snapped toward him. The simple act of turning her neck sent a protest through her muscles. She saw the focus in Jaune’s eyes, the hard-won clarity of the Rusted Knight, and it was enough to shatter her own paralysis. He was looking to her. They all were.

She pushed herself to her feet, a monumental effort. Her legs trembled, unused to bearing her full, leaden weight. She stumbled over to Weiss, her boots sinking into the deep sand. She knelt, her knee screaming at the impact.

“Weiss,” she said, her voice softer but no less strained. “Look at me.”

Weiss flinched but slowly, agonizingly, lifted her head. Her face was smudged with dirt, her lips already cracked. Despair swam in her eyes. “It hurts,” she whispered, the sound barely audible. “Everything is… loud. And sharp.”

“I know,” Ruby said, and in that moment, the shared misery was a strange and terrible bond. “But we can’t stay here. We’ll be baked alive.”

“The ridge,” Jaune said, joining them. He didn’t bother to brush the sand from his clothes; it was a futile gesture. He pointed, his arm a stark line against the white sky. “To the west. Maybe a mile. There could be overhangs. Caves. Shade.”

Shade. The word was a prayer. A promise of relief so profound it was almost painful to contemplate.

Ruby looked from the desperate hope on Jaune’s face to the fragile terror on Weiss’s. The path forward began to solidify, clearing the fog of shock. Strategy, not sorrow, was what they needed now.

“He’s right,” Ruby affirmed, her voice gaining a sliver of its old authority. “Our objective is clear. First, shelter. We get to that ridge.” She paused, her gaze scanning their meager possessions—the tattered remnants of their Ever After clothes, nothing more. “Second, supplies. We need water above all else. Shelter first, then we search. Third…” she hesitated, the immensity of their situation threatening to overwhelm her again. “Third, information. We need to know where we are. *When* we are. If there are people.”

Blake lowered her hands from her ears, her expression grim but focused. The pragmatism of the plan was a rock to cling to in the sea of her pain. “We have to watch out for each other,” she added, her voice gaining strength. “If one of us falters, we all fall. We move together.”

Yang nodded, forcing herself upright next to Blake. “One mile. In this heat, it might as well be a hundred,” she said, her voice a low growl. “We need to pace ourselves. Conserve every drop of energy.”

A plan. It was fragile, born of desperation and whispered in the face of a gale, but it was a plan. It was a purpose. The emotional storm began to recede, replaced by the cold, sharp focus of necessity. They were no longer lost children lamenting a strange paradise. They were survivors.

Ruby met Jaune’s gaze, then Yang’s, Blake’s, and Weiss’s, seeing her own grim determination mirrored back at her. She stood, offering a hand to Weiss. She took it, her grip surprisingly firm. Together, they pulled her to her feet. The five of them stood for a moment, a tiny, defiant island in a vast ocean of hostile sand and sky, their shadows stark and short beneath the tyrannical sun.

“To the ridge,” Ruby said, her voice clear and hard above the wind.

She took the first step. One foot. Then the other. A pilgrimage back to the land of the living.

---

The silence that followed their return was a fraud. It was a thin veneer stretched taut over a cacophony of howling wind and the frantic, ragged symphony of their own breathing. Here, in the heart of Vacuo’s desolation, the world was an anvil and the sun a hammer, beating down with a relentless, percussive force that baked the very air until it shimmered like troubled water.

Jaune felt the whiplash of his own existence in every straining breath. For what felt like a lifetime, he had been the Rusted Knight, his movements encased in the groaning protest of ancient metal, his world viewed through a slit of corroded steel. His joints had carried the deep, sonorous ache of decades. Now, gravity was a shocking reclamation. He felt the pull of the world on muscles that were impossibly, unnervingly young. A phantom ache for joints he no longer possessed ghosted through his limbs, a bewildering echo of a man he was and wasn't. He lifted a hand, flexing fingers that were lean and unscarred, and felt the alien lightness of his own skull without the crushing weight of his helmet.

He looked up, not at the sky, but at the sun. It was a judgment, a white-hot crucible suspended in a pitiless sapphire expanse, and its light was a physical blade against the eyes. He squinted, the motion pulling at skin that felt too tight, too smooth. “The sun is past its zenith,” he said, his voice a raw rasp against the wind’s scouring howl. It wasn’t the pronouncement of a leader, but the simple, weary observation of a man who had learned to read the sky as his only clock for far too long. “If we stay here, we’re just waiting to be buried or baked.”

His gaze fell on the others, each trapped in their own private crucible.

Weiss was a study in rigid misery. In the Ever After, her body had been a construct, a tiny, determined doll of carved wood and painted porcelain. Here, physicality had returned with a vengeance. Gravity felt like a personal affront, a coarse hand pressing her down into the granular torment of the sand. A fine, gritty film coated her tongue, her skin, the inside of her pristine white coat, which was already looking like a fool’s choice. Sweat, a sensation she had almost forgotten, traced icy, unwelcome paths down her spine. Every muscle, once remembering the effortless grace of a fencer or the porcelain brittleness of her smaller form, now screamed with the unfamiliar strain of simply existing against this oppressive heat. She felt heavy, clumsy, a creature of ice and precision thrust into a forge’s breath. *This is real,* a part of her mind chanted, a mantra of disbelief and despair. *This is not a story. The aches are real. The thirst is real.*

Beside her, Blake was trying to shrink into herself. The wind, for the others a source of noise and grit, was for her a direct assault. It was a sibilant whisper and a banshee’s lament funneled directly into her sensitive ears, each gust a fresh wave of static and sand that made her want to claw them off. The blinding glare had rendered her Faunus night vision utterly useless, replacing it with a throbbing headache centered behind her eyes. She could feel every grain of sand that had worked its way under her collar, into her boots, a thousand tiny points of irritation. She shifted, and the familiar, grinding complaint in her lumbar from the weight of Gambol Shroud was almost a comfort—a known pain in a world of overwhelming, hostile sensation. She had spent so long running from herself, from her past. In the Ever After, she’d been forced to confront that. Now, the path wasn't behind or away; it was simply *forward*, into this furnace. And it was terrifying.

Then there was Yang. She stood with her feet planted wide, a defiant silhouette against the shimmering horizon. For her, the heat was a tangible enemy, something to be met with a stubborn glare and clenched fists. But it was a battle she was losing. Her cybernetic arm, a marvel of Atlesian engineering, had become a brand. The metal, exposed to the direct solar onslaught, was a conduit of pure heat, radiating a searing warmth through its socket into the very bone of her shoulder. She consciously kept it away from her body, the air around it visibly wavering. Phantom pangs from an arm long since turned to dust mingled with the memory of its brief, fleshy return in the fairy-tale world. She was the team’s engine, its forward momentum, but even she felt her energy being leached away, drawn out of her by the merciless sun. Her gaze flickered to Ruby, and the fire in her eyes banked into a smoldering, protective concern.

Ruby herself was the quietest of all. She stood slightly apart, Crescent Rose planted in the sand beside her like a grim, metal shepherd’s crook. For her, the return to Remnant felt less like a homecoming and more like an eviction. In the moments after ascending, her body had felt ethereal, light, almost disconnected. Now, reality was crashing back in. Her bones felt hollow, like a bird’s, and gravity was a thief, stealing the very air from her lungs before she could draw it in. The light was too much, the noise of the wind too loud; it was all a sensory overload that left her feeling detached, watching the scene through a haze of heat and exhaustion. The metallic scent of her scythe, the familiar heft of its grip in her hand—these were the only anchors tethering her to this blistering present. *I led them here,* the insidious thought whispered, a chilling counterpoint to the hot wind. *I led them to the fall. Now… what?* She looked at Jaune, then at Weiss and Blake and her sister, seeing not just her team, but the totality of her responsibility manifest as four figures slowly being worn down by the elements.

Jaune pushed himself to his feet. The motion was graceless, a struggle in the deep, yielding sand. The metal plates of his armor, once a source of comfort and identity, now felt like an oven. He scanned the horizon, a slow, methodical sweep learned from endless, lonely patrols. His eyes, accustomed to the muted colors of the Ever After, squinted against the glare until he found it.

“There,” he said, pointing. His voice was stronger now, imbued with a sliver of purpose.

They followed his outstretched arm. In the distance, distorted by the atmospheric shimmer, was a darker line against the endless ochre and gold—a spine of rock, a low-lying mesa. It wasn’t salvation, but it was something other than sand. It was a feature. A destination.

“Rock formations,” Jaune elaborated, his strategic mind, honed by solitary decades, clicking back into place. “They can mean shelter from the wind. Shade. And where there’s shade and rock, there’s a chance of condensation. Maybe even a spring.”

It was the first tendril of hope any of them had felt since they’d opened their eyes in this wasteland.

Yang was the first to react, moving to Ruby’s side and gripping her shoulder. The warmth from her flesh-and-blood hand was a stark contrast to the radiating heat of her prosthetic. “You heard the man, sis. One foot in front of the other.”

Ruby looked at her sister’s face, then at the determined set of Jaune’s jaw, the weary resolve in Weiss’s eyes, the quiet nod from Blake. She felt a fractional shift inside her, the brittle hollowness gaining an ounce of substance. She wasn’t leading them now. They were moving together.

With a collective groan of strained muscles and protesting leather, they hefted their weapons. The weight of them was immense, a physical manifestation of the burdens they all carried. Ruby folded Crescent Rose into its compact form, the metallic clicks sharp and final in the wind. Blake secured Gambol Shroud. Weiss straightened her back, a queen reclaiming her posture even in hell.

Jaune took the first step, then another, his boots sinking into the sand, setting a slow, deliberate pace. Yang and Blake fell in on either side of Ruby, a human shield against the elements. Weiss brought up the rear, her eyes scanning their back trail for a moment before turning resolutely forward.

The crashed shell of the transport they’d arrived in was already receding behind them, a monument to their impossible journey. Ahead lay only the shimmering, hostile beauty of the desert. They walked, and for the first time since falling, they were not just surviving. They were returning.
