With a final, protesting shriek of tortured metal, the cockpit door gave way under Jaune’s sustained, desperate shove. It bent inward, peeling back from the frame just enough for them to squeeze through. The immediate shift in atmosphere was a physical blow. Outside, the world was an incandescent crucible of heat and light; inside, it was a tomb—shadow-choked, stifling, and thick with the acrid stench of fried circuitry and ozone. The heat was different here, not the clean, baking power of the sun, but a trapped, suffocating warmth that clung to the skin like a fever.

Ruby was the first to slip through the gap, her lithe frame moving with a hunter’s instinct. Her brief disorientation from the desert’s glare vanished, replaced by the razor-sharp focus of a leader assessing a threat. The weight of Remnant’s gravity, a sensation still alien and profound, seemed to double in the enclosed space, pulling her down, grounding her in the grim reality of the scene. Her silver eyes, accustomed to the gloom, scanned the interior with meticulous speed. A four-seat cockpit, designed for a patrol skiff. The forward canopy was a spiderweb of catastrophic fractures, though remarkably intact. Dents marred the central console, shaped not by claws, but by the desperate impact of a helmet or a fist. A standard-issue sidearm lay on the floor plating, its energy cell ejected and missing. Every detail screamed of a frantic, final few seconds. This wasn't a simple crash. This was a plummet.

Weiss followed, her posture ramrod straight despite the low ceiling, a conscious effort to project an authority she felt cracking internally. The oppressive closeness grated on her, a stark, unwelcome contrast to the boundless, if bizarre, freedom of the Ever After. She pressed a gloved hand against a bulkhead to steady herself, the metal cool and unyielding. Her mind, a fortress of logic and analysis, fought to catalog the evidence, to impose order on the chaos. *Impact vector suggests a near-vertical descent. Minimal forward momentum. They fell, they didn't fly into the ground.* Her gaze locked onto a deep tear in the upholstery of the co-pilot’s chair, the synthetic fibers shredded. *A struggle? Or just the violence of the landing?* She inhaled slowly through her nose, trying to filter the burnt air, her own controlled breaths a stark counterpoint to the silent pandemonium around her.

Blake slid in next, a shadow detaching itself from the blinding light of the doorway. The sudden quiet was a shock to her Faunus senses. The howling desert wind was instantly muted, replaced by a low, resonant hum from the skiff’s dying power core and the almost imperceptible groan of the hull settling under its own weight. Her ears, swiveling beneath her bow, drank in the new soundscape. She trusted her hearing implicitly, especially here, where shadows clung to every corner. She could clearly discern the soft scuff of Ruby’s boots on the floor, the faint rustle of Weiss’s jacket, the ragged edge to Yang’s breathing. Every tiny sound was amplified, a testament to the dead silence of the cockpit itself. It was a sterile, mechanical silence, holding its breath.

Yang had to duck to get through the mangled doorway, and the confinement was immediate and absolute. A visceral, burning impatience surged through her chest. It wasn't fear, but a raw, kinetic frustration. Her body, accustomed to wide-open brawls and the freedom to move, felt caged. The cockpit walls seemed to press in, not on her mind, but on her very muscles, on the coiled energy perpetually thrumming just beneath her skin. She felt like a live wire in a sealed jar. Her fists clenched and unclenched at her sides, the phantom sensation of Ember Celica’s weight a familiar ache in her forearms. Her gaze darted around, not seeking clues, but an outlet, a target, something to *hit*. She wanted to punch a hole through the wall just to be able to breathe air that wasn’t stale with death and defeat.

Jaune was the last to enter, his broad shoulders filling the gap completely for a moment, casting the interior into near-total darkness before he stepped fully inside. The physical exertion of forcing the door left his muscles trembling, a reminder of his own renewed, yet achingly human, limits. He stood for a moment, his quiet stoicism a stark contrast to Yang’s restless energy. His eyes, now older and etched with a grief he held deep within, swept the scene with a practiced, methodical calm that he had paid dearly to learn. He wasn’t just looking; he was searching, his mind patiently working through the last moments of the crew. His gaze fell past the discarded pistol, past the dented console, to a spot beneath the pilot’s seat.

A flicker of movement. No, not movement. A flicker of light.

“Ruby,” he said, his voice low and steady, yet it cut through the tension like a blade.

He knelt, the groan of his knee joints audible in the hush. Reaching under the seat, his fingers brushed against a cold, metallic surface and the stiff fabric of a pilot’s gauntlet, still wrapped around its final charge. He carefully worked the object free. It was a datapad, its casing cracked and its screen a mosaic of splintered glass. But it was still alive. A faint, blue light pulsed from its heart.

The others gathered around him, their bodies crowding the already cramped space. Yang leaned over Blake’s shoulder, Weiss peered past Jaune’s arm, their collective breath held in a single, unified moment of suspense. Ruby knelt beside Jaune, her reflection a pale, ghostly image next to his in the shattered screen.

Jaune angled the device, and the text became clear. It wasn’t a log. It was an open, unterminated emergency broadcast, the last words of a dead pilot typed out in a final, desperate burst. The message was short, unfinished, each word a hammer blow against the fragile hope they had just begun to nurture.

**<COMM_OPEN: VACUO REGIONAL DEFENSE NET // PRIORITY OMEGA>**
**They're here... Sky is falling... Grimm are not... not like before... request immedi—**
**<SIGNAL TERMINATED>**

The cursor blinked once, twice, at the end of the fragmented word, a tiny, rhythmic pulse in the suffocating silence. *Not like before.* The phrase echoed in the shared space between them, colder and sharper than any blade. It landed in Ruby’s mind, shattering the image of the familiar, mindless monsters they had fought their entire lives. A new variable. A new, unknown terror in a world they no longer recognized. The blinking cursor was a mocking heartbeat, counting down the seconds in a war that had evidently changed its rules while they were away. Jaune’s face, illuminated in that ghostly blue light, was a mask of hardened dread. Beside him, Ruby’s silver eyes were wide, reflecting the chilling, unfinished sentence, her mind racing to comprehend the full, horrifying weight of their return.
