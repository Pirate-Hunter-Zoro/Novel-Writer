The breach was a symphony of grinding metal and splintering glass, a harsh counterpoint to the whispering sands.  Ruby, first through the jagged opening, tasted dust and ozone on her tongue, the metallic tang clinging to the back of her throat. The cockpit was a tomb, bathed in the dim green glow of the emergency lights.  The air, thick with the coppery scent of blood and the acrid bite of burnt wiring, hung heavy and stagnant, a stark contrast to the dry, scouring wind outside.

Ruby’s semblance flickered, a nervous twitch of displaced energy.  *It’s real,* she thought, the unreality of their return momentarily solidified by the claustrophobic confines of the wrecked skiff.  *We’re really back.* The weight of leadership settled heavily on her young shoulders, a familiar burden she’d almost forgotten in the ethereal calm of the Ever After.

Weiss, her face pale beneath a fine layer of dust, entered behind Ruby, a hand instinctively rising to brush stray strands of white hair from her eyes.  She fought to maintain her composure, each precise breath a measured act against the rising tide of panic. *Control,* she told herself fiercely. *Observe. Analyze.* Her gaze swept the interior, cataloging every detail – the deep gouges in the control panel, the shattered navigation screen, the pilot's seat ripped from its moorings.

Blake, her Faunus ears twitching, was next.  A low growl rumbled in her chest, a primal response to the scent of blood and the lingering aura of fear that permeated the cockpit.  Her senses, heightened by her feline heritage, painted a vivid picture of the struggle that had taken place within these confined walls. *Something’s wrong,* she thought, the hairs on the back of her neck prickling. *Very wrong.*

Yang, last through the breach, slammed her fist against a dented bulkhead, the metallic clang echoing through the confined space.  Frustration, hot and visceral, pulsed through her veins. “Damn it!” she snarled, her voice thick with suppressed fury. The protective instinct that burned within her was a roaring inferno, fueled by the palpable sense of danger.

Jaune entered last, his movements measured and deliberate. Outwardly stoic, his mind was a maelstrom of conflicting emotions.  The Ever After had changed him, tempered his grief with a newfound maturity. But the raw, visceral fear remained, a cold knot in his stomach.  He scanned the wreckage, his gaze lingering on a discarded weapon lying near the pilot’s seat – a shattered halberd, its broken shaft gleaming dully in the emergency lights.  *This isn’t a training exercise anymore,* he thought grimly.

The search began, a frantic scramble in the cramped space. Ruby, driven by a desperate need to understand, rifled through the debris, her fingers brushing against something hard and flat tucked beneath the mangled pilot’s seat.  It was a datapad, its screen cracked like spiderwebs but still flickering with a faint luminescence.

As she lifted it, the others crowded around, their breaths catching in their throats.  On the cracked screen, a single, unfinished message glowed ominously: “They’re here… Sky is falling… Grimm are not… not like before… request immedi—” The message abruptly cut off, the final word incomplete, a chilling testament to the suddenness of the attack.

The implications of those fragmented words hit them like a physical blow.  The air in the cockpit grew thick with a suffocating dread.  The return of gravity felt heavier now, a tangible reminder of the brutal reality they had returned to. The lingering oddities of their Ever After transformations – the faint echo of otherworldly sensations, the unfamiliar lightness in their limbs – seemed to vanish in an instant, replaced by the familiar aches and pains of their physical bodies.  The fight was back. And it was worse than they could have imagined.
