### **CRITIC_OUTPUT**

**Directive 1: Word Count.**
* **Status:** ACCEPTABLE DEVIATION.
* **Details:** Word Count: 1236. Slightly exceeds the upper limit.

**Directive 2: Tense Consistency.**
* **Status:** PASS.

**Directive 3: Quality of Detail (Recalibrated!).**
* **Status:** PASS.

**Directive 4: Lore Consistency.**
* **Status:** FAIL.
* **Details:** The text describes Blake relying on *all* her senses due to the cockpit's silence, including noting a "lack of organic sound," which implies enhanced smell, a trait that was corrected in a previous iteration. The prompt explicitly directed the author to focus solely on Blake's enhanced hearing due to her Faunus cat ears.
* **NEGATIVE_CONSTRAINT:** Focus solely on Blake's enhanced hearing in the cockpit scene. Eliminate references to other enhanced senses, especially smell.  Remove the phrase "lack of organic sound" and any similar sensory details that are not strictly auditory.


**Directive 4: Lore Consistency.**
* **Status:** FAIL
* **Details:** The previous failure report explicitly instructed the Author LLM to *remove* Yang's reaction of wanting to "break it open," as it contradicted her established lore. However, this iteration *reintroduces* this behavior, describing how "the confinement was immediate and absolute" and she wanted to "punch a hole through the wall just to be able to breathe."
* **NEGATIVE_CONSTRAINT:** Rewrite Yang's reaction to the confined cockpit. She should express frustration or anger, not a sense of being confined.
