[Section 1-D]

The groaning metal of the skiff’s mangled door shrieked in protest as Ruby forced it open, the sound a jarring counterpoint to the whispering wind.  Dust motes, disturbed by the intrusion, danced in the sudden influx of light, revealing a cockpit choked with the detritus of a desperate last stand.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and the cloying sweetness of ozone, a grim testament to the violence that had played out within these cramped walls.

Ruby stepped inside, each footfall echoing in the unnatural silence.  The world outside, the endless expanse of desert and sky, felt distant, unreal.  Here, in the suffocating confines of the cockpit, the reality of their return pressed down on her, heavy and suffocating. *We're back,* she thought, the words a hollow echo in the vast emptiness of her mind. *And it's worse than we left.*

Weiss followed close behind, her hand instinctively going to Myrtenaster, the cool metal a reassuring presence against her palm. The disarray assaulted her senses – wires sparking from a fractured control panel, a shattered viewport spiderwebbing across the floor, a discarded firearm lying amidst a spray of dark, viscous fluid. Her breath hitched, a small, involuntary gasp escaping her lips. *Control,* a voice whispered in her mind, sharp and insistent. *Maintain control.*

Blake, her Faunus senses heightened, entered last, her feline ears twitching, picking up the faintest of sounds – the drip of something viscous onto metal, the whisper of the wind through a cracked seal.  The scent of fear, sharp and acrid, still clung to the air, a phantom presence in the otherwise silent cockpit. A deep unease settled in her stomach, a premonition of something terrible yet to be discovered. *They were afraid,* she thought, her gaze sweeping the wreckage. *And they had every right to be.*

Yang, her fists clenched tight, surveyed the scene with a simmering rage. The sight of the ravaged cockpit, the evidence of a struggle lost, ignited a protective fury within her. She could almost feel the desperation, the fear, that had permeated this space in the final moments.  *Who did this?* she thought, her teeth grinding together. *I'll make them pay.*

Jaune, trailing behind the others, moved with a newfound quiet intensity. His gaze, usually bright and eager, was shadowed, his expression unreadable. He absorbed the details of the carnage – a dented console, a scorch mark on the wall, the lingering metallic tang in the air – each observation etching itself onto the canvas of his grief-stricken mind.  He said nothing, but his silence spoke volumes.  The weight of Pyrrha's memory, the burden of leadership, settled heavily on his shoulders, a constant reminder of what he had lost, and what he had to protect.

Ruby’s gaze fell upon a glint of metal beneath the pilot’s seat, half-buried in the debris.  She reached down, her fingers brushing against something cold and smooth. Pulling it free, she recognized it instantly: a datapad, its screen cracked, but still flickering with a faint, ethereal light.  

With trembling hands, she activated the device, the cracked screen sputtering to life, displaying a single, unfinished message. The text, stark white against a black background, seemed to burn itself into her retinas.  "They're here... Sky is falling... Grimm are not... not like before... request immedi—"  The message abruptly cut off, the final word incomplete, hanging in the air like a phantom limb.

The silence in the cockpit deepened, broken only by the soft hum of the datapad. Time seemed to stretch, distorting, as the meaning of the fragmented message sunk in. The blood drained from Ruby’s face, leaving her skin ashen. Her grip on the datapad tightened, her knuckles white.  The abstract threat of their return, the lingering unreality of their escape from the Ever After, solidified into a chilling, immediate terror.

Weiss, peering over Ruby's shoulder, gasped, her carefully constructed composure crumbling. The words on the screen, fragmented and incomplete, painted a picture more terrifying than any she could have imagined. *Not like before,* she thought, the phrase echoing in her mind, a chilling premonition of horrors yet to come.

Blake's breath hitched, her eyes widening in understanding.  The fear she had sensed in the cockpit, the desperation that clung to the air, suddenly made horrifying sense. *They faced something new,* she realized, a shiver running down her spine. *Something worse.*

Yang's simmering rage hardened into a cold, steely resolve. The unfinished message, the implied threat, fueled her protective instincts, transforming her grief into a burning desire for action. *We're going to need a bigger gun,* she thought, her hand instinctively going to her Ember Celica.

Jaune stared at the datapad, his expression grim. The unfinished message confirmed his deepest fears, solidifying the reality of the danger they faced. He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, and when he opened them again, his gaze was steady, resolute.  The weight of leadership settled on him, a heavy mantle, but he did not falter.  *We have to be ready,* he thought, the words a silent vow.  *For whatever comes next.*

The datapad’s flickering light illuminated their faces, casting long, distorted shadows against the wrecked cockpit walls.  In the suffocating silence, the unfinished message hung in the air, a chilling testament to the horrors that awaited them.
