The world returned with the subtlety of a body slam.

One moment, there was the placid un-reality of the Ever After—a kaleidoscope of impossible logic and dreamlike purpose. The next, there was pain. And heat. And gravity.

Gravity was the first true tormentor. It was a physical malevolence, a colossal hand pressing down on Jaune’s shoulders, spine, and soul. He gasped, the air a furnace blast that seared his lungs, and collapsed onto a dune of searing, rust-colored sand. His body, which for decades had carried the heavy, weary mantle of the Rusted Knight, was now jarringly young, a flimsy cage of aching bone and screaming muscle. He could feel the granular scrape of sand against his cheek, the sting of sweat in his eyes, the frantic, terrified thumping of a heart that felt too fast, too strong. The memory of his older, slower body—the phantom ache in joints that were no longer worn—made his current, lighter form an agony all its own.

A keening wind howled around him, a physical presence that scoured his skin and filled his ears with a desolate shriek. It lifted plumes of dust that tasted of ancient decay and stung his eyes. The sun was not a benevolent star but a malevolent god, a white-hot hammer pounding the anvil of the world, bleaching all color to a blinding, featureless glare. The air itself shimmered, a visible distortion that made the horizon dance and wobble like a fever dream.

*Get up,* his mind commanded, the voice of a leader who’d spent an eternity failing. *They need you.* But the order dissolved against the sheer, crushing weight of his reverted youth. He pushed a hand into the sand, the fine grains flowing through his fingers like liquid fire, and the simple act of leverage sent a jolt of agony through a wrist that felt unnervingly fragile.

A sound nearby, half-choke, half-sob, drew his attention. Weiss was on her knees a few feet away, her head bowed. Her long, white hair, usually a pristine banner, was matted with sweat and dirt. She was clutching her stomach, her breaths coming in ragged, shallow pants. In the Ever After, her mind had been a gilded cage, her reality warped and twisted by a puppeteer’s strings. She had known no certainty, no solid ground, no true north.

Her internal world was a cacophony of abhorrent sensations. The slosh of liquid in her gut. The grating of bone in its socket. The claustrophobic prison of her own skin felt real—too real—after the curated falsehoods she’d endured. She could feel every individual hair on her arms lifting in the hot wind, an unbearable, tickling friction. The blood pounding in her ears was a deafening drum against the memory of insidious, persuasive whispers. *This is wrong,* her thoughts screamed, a frantic spiral of revulsion. *This is too much. Too loud. I’m trapped again.* She squeezed her eyes shut, but the incandescent light still burned through her eyelids, painting the world in violent shades of red and orange.

Further off, Yang was a study in rigid fury. She was already on her feet, a defiance born of sheer, protective instinct. Her knuckles were white where she reflexively clenched her fist, the familiar weight of her prosthetic arm a cold, grounding shock. For her time in the Ever After, physics had been a suggestion. Now, a trickle of blood ran from a cut on her lip where she’d bitten it, and the salty, metallic taste was an infuriatingly real shock. She felt a scrape on her forearm from the fall, a raw, tender patch of skin that felt impossibly vulnerable.

She flexed her fingers, a tremor running through them. The softness of her own flesh was a liability. She remembered a world where falls were gentle, where consequence was negotiable. Now, she was a sack of fragile tissues and coursing fluids. A single misstep could shatter a bone, could spill her life onto this scorched earth. The thought was not just frightening; it was infuriating, a deep, cellular humiliation. She was a huntress, but she felt like glass, anticipating the crack. The wind, once a triviality, now felt like a thousand tiny needles, a constant reminder of how easily she and her family could be hurt. Her gaze was already locked on her sister.

It was Ruby’s quiet weeping that finally broke the spell of their individual hells.

She was the youngest, curled into a ball, her small frame shaking with uncontrolled tremors. In the Ever After, she had faced the abyss of herself and chosen to Ascend, to shed everything she was. She had been offered harmony—the peace of oblivion. Now, she was a symphony of discord.

"I can feel my own heartbeat," she whispered, her voice cracking, barely audible over the wind’s mournful song. "It's so... loud. It hurts."

Jaune forced himself to move. Every motion was a negotiation with pain. He crawled, dragging his protesting body across the few feet of sand that separated them, the heat radiating through his worn hoodie. He reached her, his hand hovering over her shaking shoulder, a sudden uncertainty gripping him. What comfort could he offer? He, the man who’d aged decades in isolation, felt just as lost as she did.

He let his hand rest on her back. The warmth of her, the fragile beat of life beneath his palm, was both a reassurance and a terror.

"I know, Ruby," he said, his voice a raw rasp. He had to swallow twice to get the words out, his throat caked with dust. "I know."

Yang was at her side in an instant, dropping to her knees with a grit of teeth. Her jaw was clenched, a muscle twitching in her cheek. "We're out. That's what matters," she bit out, but there was no conviction in it. It was the automatic response of a protector, a hollow mantra she didn't believe herself. She looked at her own hand, at the delicate network of veins beneath the skin. *Weak.*

Weiss lifted her head, her eyes—the color of a storm-wracked sea—glistening with unshed tears. "It's the gravity," she breathed, her voice airy and strange, as if still unmoored. "Gravity is a cruel anchor. It reminds you that you are bound to the dirt." She looked from Jaune's agonized posture to Yang's bristling anger. "That place... it wasn't real."

The admission hung in the shimmering air, a profound and terrible truth. They had been stripped of their complex, painful reality and given a different kind of existence. Now, being wholly themselves again felt like a punishment.

Jaune drew a shuddering breath, the hot air a trial. "I was old," he confessed, the words tasting like ash. "So old. I could feel the years in my bones, but I couldn't... ache like this." He looked at his own hands, calloused but unlined and trembling. "I'd forgotten what it was to feel breakable."

Yang finally let her shoulders slump, a fraction of her fighter’s façade crumbling. "I forgot how much everything could hurt," she said, her gaze fixed on the endless dunes. "The weight of it all." She touched the complex machinery of her own arm, then the cut on her lip, her finger coming away red. She stared at it, mesmerized by the proof of her own vulnerability.

Ruby’s sobs softened into quiet, hiccupping breaths. She uncurled slightly, leaning into Jaune's touch. "I almost wasn't anything," she whispered. "I didn't have to breathe."

The four of them remained there, a tableau of broken pilgrims marooned in a purgatorial wasteland. The wind howled on, indifferent. The sun beat down, merciless. They were raw, exposed, and flayed by the return to a world they had fought to save.

"We're not what we were," Jaune said, his voice gaining a sliver of its former strength, albeit aged with a weariness that didn't match his face. He wasn't speaking as a commander now, but as a fellow survivor. "The Ever After... it took something from us. And it left something behind." He looked at each of them, his gaze lingering—on Weiss's haunted eyes, Yang's newfound fragility, Ruby's terror. "But we're here. We are *here*."

He shifted, a grunt of pain escaping him, and moved to create a small huddle, urging the others closer with a gesture. Weiss crawled forward, her movements clumsy. Yang, after a long moment of hesitation, shuffled over, her pride warring with a desperate need for contact. They came together, a small, fragile circle against the vast, hostile emptiness. Their shoulders touched. Jaune’s aching arm went around Ruby; Weiss’s hand found Yang’s wrist, and she didn’t pull away.

"We'll carry this," Jaune murmured, the words for them alone, nearly stolen by the wind. "But we'll carry it together."

In the shelter of their small, human circle, the heat felt marginally less oppressive, the wind's shriek a little less personal. They were broken, yes. But they were no longer alone in their breaking.
