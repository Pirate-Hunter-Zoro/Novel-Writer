[Section 1-E]

The echo of the Grimm’s final, guttural rasp seemed to hang in the air, a morbid counterpoint to the silence that had descended upon the cockpit.  The adrenaline, a roaring torrent only moments ago, receded like a treacherous tide, leaving behind a chilling emptiness.  The datapad lay deactivated on the console, its message a stark epitaph to any lingering hope.  They weren’t just back; they were back to a nightmare.

Ruby’s breath hitched, a shallow gasp lost in the vastness of the ruined skiff.  The unreality she had clung to, a flimsy shield against the crushing weight of their situation, shattered.  Her eyes, moments ago wide with bewildered wonder, now narrowed, their silver depths reflecting the harsh, unforgiving light of the Vacuan sun.  Her fingers curled around the hilt of Crescent Rose, the familiar metal a grounding presence in a world that felt alien and hostile.  *We’re back… and we’ve already lost.*

Weiss’s composure, a meticulously constructed façade, finally fractured.  A tremor ran through her, so subtle only Blake, pressed close beside her, would have noticed.  Her gaze darted from the slain Grimm to the datapad, to Ruby’s stricken face, cataloging every detail with a desperate, analytical precision.  *Control.  I need control.* The mantra echoed in her mind, a fragile bulwark against the rising tide of panic.  This wasn’t the triumphant return she had envisioned.  This was a battlefield, and they were already outnumbered.

Blake’s Faunus senses, heightened by the lingering adrenaline, picked up the subtle shift in the air pressure as Weiss inhaled sharply.  Her amber eyes, dilated in the dim light of the cockpit, flicked towards her teammate, a silent acknowledgment of the shared fear.  The scent of dust and decay, the acrid tang of ozone, and the coppery undercurrent of blood assaulted her nostrils, a grim reminder of the reality they had returned to. *We're not safe. Not here. Not anywhere.* The thought resonated deep within her, a primal echo of a life spent on the run.

Yang’s hand clenched, the knuckles white against the worn leather of her glove.  A raw, visceral frustration thrummed through her, a burning ember of protective rage.  They had been so close, so tantalizingly close to answers, only to be thrown back into this desolate wasteland.  Her eyes, usually vibrant with an irrepressible energy, smoldered with a darker fire.  *They took so much from us. They won't take anything else.* The silent vow resonated with the steady beat of her heart.

Jaune, his back against the bulkhead, remained outwardly still, a statue carved from grief and weary acceptance.  But beneath the stoic mask, a storm raged. The datapad's message, a cold, clinical report of loss and devastation, had struck him with the force of a physical blow.  His gaze drifted towards the viewport, taking in the endless expanse of desert, the swirling dust devils dancing like mocking spirits.  He saw not emptiness, but the ghosts of fallen comrades, the weight of responsibility pressing down on him with renewed intensity. *We have to fight. For them. For everything we've lost.* The thought was not a question, but a stark, unyielding truth.

One by one, they emerged from the wreckage of the skiff, blinking against the blinding glare of the Vacuan sun.  The desert air, thick with dust and the metallic tang of blood, filled their lungs with a gritty, unwelcome familiarity.  The familiar aches and pains of their physical forms, absent in the ephemeral realm of the Ever After, returned with a vengeance – the dull throb in Ruby’s shoulder, the stiffness in Weiss’s back, the phantom sting of Blake’s severed tail, the ache in Yang’s prosthetic arm, the persistent soreness in Jaune’s legs.  The weight of gravity, once taken for granted, now felt like a physical burden.

They stood in a silent circle, their gazes fixed on the horizon, the wreckage of the skiff a stark monument to their shattered hopes.  The desert stretched before them, an endless expanse of ochre and sand, no longer a symbol of emptiness but a vast, hungry beast waiting to devour them.  The wind howled, a mournful dirge that echoed the desolate landscape of their hearts.  This wasn’t the homecoming they had dreamed of.  This was a war, and they were already losing.

The sun beat down on them, merciless and unforgiving.  They were home, but they were not safe. They were alive, but they were surrounded by ghosts.  They were together, but they were utterly alone.  The fight had just begun.
