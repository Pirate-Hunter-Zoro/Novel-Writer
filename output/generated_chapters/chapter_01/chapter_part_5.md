The silence that descended in the skiff’s cockpit was heavier than gravity, more suffocating than the dust-choked air. The datapad, having delivered its payload of despair, slipped from Weiss’s numb fingers and clattered onto the grated floor. The sound was obscenely loud, a single, sharp crack in a vacuum of frozen horror.

Weiss didn’t flinch. She stared at the spot on the metal decking where the device lay, its screen still glowing with the brutally concise eulogy for her entire world. *Strategic loss. Evacuation to Vacuo. Kingdom of Atlas no longer viable.* The words were sterile, clinical, stripped of the screaming chaos they represented. A home, a culture, a global superpower… reduced to a footnote in a field report. An immense, hollow cavern opened in her chest, a place where shock and grief were supposed to be, but for now, there was only a profound, ringing emptiness. The desert’s oppressive heat felt like a distant annoyance, irrelevant against the absolute zero that had seized her heart. Her composure, that meticulously constructed fortress of discipline and pride, was not breaking; it had been annihilated, leaving her exposed and shivering in the furnace of this new reality.

Ruby watched the light drain from Weiss’s face. For a fleeting, mad second, her mind tried to reject it all, to categorize this as just another nonsensical trial of the Ever After. But the grit of real sand between her teeth, the solid, unforgiving weight of her own body, and the genuine agony etched on her friend’s features chained her to the truth. Atlas was gone. Penny… Penny’s sacrifice had bought them time, but it hadn’t been enough. The weight of leadership, which had felt so distant in that fairytale world, came crashing back down not as a mantle, but as a shroud. It was heavy with the ghosts of people she had tried to save, thick with the smoke of a city she’d failed to protect. Her silver eyes, which had been clouded with disorientation, began to clear, the swirling confusion condensing into a hard, sharp point of light. A familiar fire, banked but never extinguished, rekindled in her soul. It wasn't the bright, optimistic flame of a girl hoping to be a hero. It was the cold, determined burn of a soldier who had run out of hope and now had only resolve left to give. Her hands, resting on her knees, slowly curled into fists, the knuckles white.

A low growl, more vibration than sound, emanated from Yang’s chest. The heat inside her flared, a stark and violent contrast to Weiss’s arctic stillness. It was a dragon’s fury, stoked by the galling poison of helplessness. While they had been lost, while they had been fighting nonsensical creatures and drinking tea with a talking mouse, their world—the *real* world—had been burning. The sheer, infuriating injustice of it all was a physical pressure behind her ribs, demanding release. She wanted to punch the bulkhead until her gauntlets buckled, to scream until her throat was raw, to find the architect of this pain and tear them apart with her bare hands. The memories of the Ever After weren't a source of trauma now; they were a source of shame. A distraction. A cosmic joke played at their expense. She felt a gentle pressure on her bicep, and her head snapped to the side.

Blake was looking at her, her golden eyes wide with a shared pain but steady, anchoring. Her hand was a small, firm point of contact in the swirling vortex of Yang’s rage. Blake’s Faunus senses were screaming. The wind whistling through the cracks in the skiff’s hull sounded like a dirge. The air tasted of ozone and ancient dust, and beneath it, the faintest, predatory tang of dormant Grimm. She processed the news of Atlas with a sickening lurch in her stomach, another home lost to violence and fear. But her focus splintered, immediately refracting onto her team. She felt Yang’s simmering rage as if it were a current in the air, saw the crystalline fragility of Weiss, perceived the immense burden settling back onto Ruby’s shoulders. Her own grief was a secondary concern, a quiet ache she would tend to later. Right now, her pack was wounded, and her instinct was singular: hold them together. Keep them from shattering before the first real battle had even begun. Her grip on Yang’s arm was a silent promise: *I’m here. We’re here.*

Jaune had been silent through it all, his gaze fixed out the fractured viewport. The shock had passed through him like a lightning strike, leaving behind the grim, quiet hum of acceptance. He was no stranger to this feeling. He had felt it at Beacon. He had felt it with Pyrrha. He had felt it with Penny. Grief was now a part of his anatomy, a phantom limb that ached with the changing of fortunes. The years in the Ever After had weathered him, eroding the frantic boy and leaving this man, a strategist forged in loneliness. *Atlas has fallen.* The logical implications unfurled in his mind. The SDC is crippled. The Atlesian military is now a refugee force. The last great bastion of technological power is gone. The global CCT network is severed permanently. Vacuo… Vacuo is now the frontline. All of it. He wasn't looking at a desert; he was looking at a battlespace. He scanned the endless dunes, noting the hollows that could provide cover, the ridges that offered sightlines. His mind, unbidden, was already calculating approach routes, defensive positions, and kill zones. This was what he had now. Not hope. Not despair. Just the next move on the board.

Slowly, deliberately, Jaune rose to his feet. The motion was stiff, his body still reacquainting itself with its proper weight and age. “We can’t stay here.” His voice was raspy, but it cut through the silence with newfound authority.

One by one, they followed his lead, a silent accord passing between them. Ruby pushed the buckled hatch open, and the desert assaulted them. A wall of heat slammed into them, stealing the breath from their lungs. The sun was a merciless, white disk in a bleached-blue sky, its light so intense it felt like a physical weight on their eyelids. The wind howled, a physical thing that whipped their hair and clothes, flinging stinging grains of sand against their exposed skin.

They stepped out of the shadow of the wreck and onto the scorched earth, five solitary figures in a sea of shimmering, hostile light. The sand shifted around their boots, the vast emptiness of the Great Desert stretching to a horizon that wavered and danced in the heat. There were no fortifications, no watchtowers, nothing but the raw, untamed savagery of Vacuo. The wreck behind them was a tombstone for their past, for the time they had lost. The wasteland before them was not just an obstacle; it was a promise.

They stood together, shoulders squared against the wind, their gazes fixed on the vast, hungry expanse. The war hadn’t been waiting for them to return. It was already here.
