**(Section 1-B: The Discovery)**

The shimmering heat haze danced like a malevolent spirit, distorting the already desolate landscape. Ruby blinked, the grit between her eyelids a constant, irritating reminder of their harsh reality.  The initial wave of disorientation receded, replaced by a cold, focused determination.  "Okay," she rasped, her voice thick with dust and unreality,  "we need to figure this out."  The lingering strangeness of their Ever After transformations clung to her, a faint echo of something… *else*. Gravity felt heavier, her own body a newly discovered weight.

Weiss, her face pale beneath a fine sheen of perspiration, straightened. The elegant lines of her usual posture were marred by a subtle tremor. "Scan the horizon," she directed, her voice tight with a controlled fear she fought to conceal. "Look for anything… out of place."  She shielded her eyes, the glare off the sand assaulting her already strained senses. Inside, a frantic whisper echoed: *Control, Weiss. Control.*

Blake, still as a statue, closed her eyes. The world sharpened in her ears. The whisper of wind across the dunes, the faint scrabble of unseen creatures beneath the sand, the pounding of her own heart – all heightened, amplified by her Faunus senses. *Something's… off.*  The Ever After's muted sensory landscape had left her acutely attuned to the slightest anomaly.  A low, rhythmic groan, barely audible beneath the wind’s howl, snagged her attention. Metal. Strained. *Unnatural.* Her golden eyes snapped open, fixed on a point in the shimmering distance.  

Yang's frustration simmered just beneath the surface, a volatile cocktail of fear and protective fury. She balled her fists, the phantom sensation of gauntlets lingering. *Where are we?* The thought echoed the raw, visceral panic that clawed at her.  She shifted her weight, the familiar ache in her prosthetic a grounding presence in this alien world. Seeing Ruby attempting to regain control steadied her, even if the worry gnawing at her insides remained.  She forced herself to focus, scanning the desolate expanse. 

Jaune, his face etched with a newfound maturity, pointed towards the north. "Start there," he instructed, his voice quiet but firm.  He, too, felt the unsettling weight of their return, the world sharper, harsher than he remembered. Grief, a constant undercurrent, tugged at him. Pyrrha. *We have to get back.*  The thought was a silent vow, a steel core within his resolve.  He watched as the others began their slow, methodical sweep of the horizon, each movement heavy with the burden of their unknown predicament.

The wind whipped around them, a relentless, abrasive force.  The heat pressed down, stealing their breath, baking the sand to a blinding white.  Time stretched, each moment a agonizing crawl.  The emptiness seemed to mock them, its vastness a physical weight.  Doubt, insidious and cold, began to creep in.

Then, Blake spoke, her voice low and urgent. "There." She pointed towards the source of the rhythmic groan, a barely perceptible flicker in the heat-haze. "Do you hear it?"

Weiss, her gaze following Blake's outstretched hand, focused her aura.  Through the shimmering air, a brief, unnatural glint caught her eye.  Metal. Or glass.  A reflection where there should only be rock and sand. *There.*

Ruby squinted, straining to see what Blake and Weiss had detected.  A flicker. A glimmer. Hope, sharp and sudden, pierced the oppressive despair.

Yang felt a jolt of adrenaline.  Finally, something. *Something.*  Her hand instinctively went to her hip, the phantom weight of Ember Celica a comforting presence.

Jaune followed their gazes, his heart pounding against his ribs. He couldn’t see it clearly yet, but the tension in his teammates, the sudden focus in their eyes, told him everything. They had a target.
