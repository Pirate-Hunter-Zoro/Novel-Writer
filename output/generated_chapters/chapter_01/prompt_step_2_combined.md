**[Begin Section 1-A]**

The world tears itself into existence around them not with a gentle fade, but with a cataclysm of sensation. One moment, the non-space of the Ever After. The next, a furnace blast of heat, a blinding white sun, and the solid, unforgiving ground.  Ruby hit the ground hard, the air knocked from her lungs. The world swam in a dizzying haze of white and ochre.  *Sand.*  Grit stung her eyes, scratching against her skin.  *Hot.*  An oppressive, suffocating heat pressed down, baking the air itself. *Real.*  The solidity of the ground beneath her was a brutal affirmation, a jarring counterpoint to the ethereal unreality she'd just left.  *Where…?*

A choked gasp beside her. Weiss, face pale, clawed at her throat, coughing.  "Air… can't… breathe…"

Jaune groaned, shielding his eyes. "My head…"

Blake landed with a cat-like grace, but even she staggered, a low growl rumbling in her chest.  Her golden eyes, narrowed against the glare, darted around, taking in the desolate landscape. *Empty. Hostile.*

Yang sat up, shaking her head, a dazed expression on her face.  Her voice, when it came, was raspy. "What… the…"

The only sound other than their ragged breathing was the low whine of the wind whipping across the endless expanse of sand.  The sky, a merciless, unbroken dome of blue, offered no shade, no respite.  It pressed down on them, a vast and indifferent presence.

Ruby blinked, trying to clear her vision.  The initial wave of disorientation began to recede, replaced by a chilling sense of vulnerability.  *Vacuo.*  The word formed in her mind, unbidden, unwelcome.  They were back. But at what cost?

"Blake?"  Her voice was a croak.

Blake swallowed, her voice thick.  "Here."

"Weiss?"

A weak cough. "Present… barely."

"Yang?"

"Ugh… yeah."

"Jaune?"

"Spinning… but here."

Five figures, huddled together in the vast emptiness, their silhouettes stark against the blinding white sand.  They were back on Remnant. Alive.  But utterly lost.

### **Prompt 1-B: The Discovery**

**Objective:** Continuing *immediately* from the previous section, this part transitions the characters from static disorientation to active investigation, culminating in the discovery of the transport skiff.

**[Begin Section 1-B]**

**(Use the full text from Section 1-A as the preceding context.)**

With the initial shock wearing off and the reality of their situation setting in, the group begins to assess their surroundings more methodically. The immediate goal is survival and information. Jaune and Ruby should naturally begin to take the lead, directing the others to scan the horizon.

The focus of this section is their first, purposeful actions as a team. As they scan the seemingly empty desert, build tension through the environment. The wind howls, carrying with it faint, unsettling sounds. The heat haze plays tricks on their eyes.

The climax of this section is the discovery. It must not be obvious.

* **Path A:** Blake's Faunus hearing, now keenly attuned after the sensory deprivation of the Ever After, picks up the faint, rhythmic groan of stressed metal carried on the wind—a sound that does not belong in nature.
* **Path B:** Weiss, shielding her eyes and trying to analyze the terrain, spots a brief, unnatural glint of light through the shimmering air, a reflection off metal or glass where there should only be rock and sand.

**Crucial Ending Point:** The section must end at the exact moment of discovery and their shared reaction to it—a new, sudden focus in the vast emptiness. They have a target.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** A shot from behind the team as they begin to spread out, scanning the horizon. Jaune is pointing into the distance. The focus is on the vast, empty desert before them, with Blake in the mid-ground, head tilted as if listening intently to something only she can hear.
