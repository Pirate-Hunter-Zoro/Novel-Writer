**[Begin Section 1-A]**

The world tears itself into existence around them not with a gentle fade, but with a cataclysm of sensation. One moment, the non-space of the Ever After. The next, a furnace blast of heat, a blinding white sun, and the solid, unforgiving ground. Ruby slammed into the earth, breath punched from her lungs.  The taste of dust filled her mouth, gritty and real. *Real.*  Her vision swam, a dizzying whirl of white sky and shifting sand.  *Sun… ground… air… I can breathe…*  A frantic, disjointed litany in her head.

Jaune landed beside her with a choked gasp, his vomit staining the pale sand. “W-what…?” he stammered, the word lost in the wind that whipped across the dunes, hot and dry as a dragon’s breath.

Weiss’s cry was thin and sharp, a sound swallowed by the immensity of the desert.  She scrambled back on her hands, her face bone-white, eyes squeezed shut.  *No… not again… not another void…* Her thoughts were frantic whispers against the roar of the wind and the pounding in her ears. *But… this is different… this is…*

Blake hit the ground with a muffled thud, landing cat-like despite the disorientation.  For a moment, she simply lay there, the scorching sand searing through her clothes.  The metallic scent of blood filled her nostrils, and she realized her hands were scraped raw. *Remnant… the air… it burns…*  A wave of nausea rolled over her, the Ever After’s lingering unreality clashing violently with the raw, brutal reality of this place.

Yang groaned, shielding her eyes from the glare with a forearm.  Her head throbbed with a dull ache. *Sand… heat… I can feel the ground…*  A small, disbelieving smile touched her lips. *Solid ground…* She pushed herself up, shaking off the lingering dizziness. "Guys?" Her voice was raspy, barely a whisper.

Ruby blinked, trying to focus.  The swirling sand gradually settled, revealing a landscape of endless dunes, stretching to the horizon in every direction.  The sky was an oppressive, cloudless expanse of white.  The heat radiated from the ground, baking her through her clothes. "Weiss? Blake? Jaune?"  Her voice was thin, cracking with dryness.

A whimper came from nearby.  Ruby turned and saw Weiss huddled on the ground, her face buried in her knees.  Blake sat beside her, her eyes wide and unfocused, still grappling with the shock.  Jaune was on his hands and knees, retching again.

"We're… we're here," Ruby whispered, more to herself than to them. "We're back."

“Back…?” Weiss’s voice was a choked whisper. “Where… is *here*?”

"Remnant," Yang croaked, her voice still thick with disorientation.  She looked around, her gaze sweeping over the desolate landscape. "I think… I think we're in Vacuo."

### **Prompt 1-B: The Discovery**

**Objective:** Continuing *immediately* from the previous section, this part transitions the characters from static disorientation to active investigation, culminating in the discovery of the transport skiff.

**[Begin Section 1-B]**

**(Use the full text from Section 1-A as the preceding context.)**

With the initial shock wearing off and the reality of their situation setting in, the group begins to assess their surroundings more methodically. The immediate goal is survival and information. Jaune and Ruby should naturally begin to take the lead, directing the others to scan the horizon.

The focus of this section is their first, purposeful actions as a team. As they scan the seemingly empty desert, build tension through the environment. The wind howls, carrying with it faint, unsettling sounds. The heat haze plays tricks on their eyes.

The climax of this section is the discovery. It must not be obvious.

* **Path A:** Blake's Faunus hearing, now keenly attuned after the sensory deprivation of the Ever After, picks up the faint, rhythmic groan of stressed metal carried on the wind—a sound that does not belong in nature.
* **Path B:** Weiss, shielding her eyes and trying to analyze the terrain, spots a brief, unnatural glint of light through the shimmering air, a reflection off metal or glass where there should only be rock and sand.

**Crucial Ending Point:** The section must end at the exact moment of discovery and their shared reaction to it—a new, sudden focus in the vast emptiness. They have a target.

**(Remember to adhere to all CORE DIRECTIVES FOR SUPERIOR WRITING QUALITY listed above.)**

**ILLUSTRATION_PROMPT:** A shot from behind the team as they begin to spread out, scanning the horizon. Jaune is pointing into the distance. The focus is on the vast, empty desert before them, with Blake in the mid-ground, head tilted as if listening intently to something only she can hear.
