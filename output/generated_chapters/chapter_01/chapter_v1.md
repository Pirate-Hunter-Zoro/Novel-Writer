## Dust and Desert: Chapter 1

The world slammed back into Ruby Rose with the force of a physical blow. Gone was the ethereal, dreamlike quality of the Ever After. Gravity, a forgotten sensation, pressed down on her with a newfound heaviness, anchoring her to the scorching sand beneath her boots.  Disorientation swirled within her, a kaleidoscope of fragmented memories and unreal sensations. Her breath hitched in her throat, tasting of dust and dryness, a stark contrast to the sweet, otherworldly air she’d grown accustomed to. The relentless sun beat down, a blinding white inferno against a canvas of azure.  She blinked, trying to clear the haze from her vision, but the world swam in a shimmering mirage of heat and exhaustion. The sand, a fine, burning powder, seeped into her clothes, chafing against her skin like a thousand tiny needles.

*This is… real?* The thought echoed in her mind, fragile and uncertain. *We’re… back?*

A low groan, a rumble of displaced earth, resonated from somewhere deep within Weiss Schnee. She swayed, a hand instinctively reaching out to steady herself against the unforgiving heat radiating from a nearby dune. The harsh, gritty reality of Vacuo assaulted her senses – the oppressive weight of the sun, the coarseness of the sand against her skin, the taste of dust coating her tongue. Each sensation was a jarring reminder of the tangible world, a world so different from the fluid, almost immaterial existence of the Ever After.  She squeezed her eyes shut, fighting the wave of nausea that threatened to overwhelm her. Beneath the surface of her carefully constructed composure, a tremor of vulnerability ran through her.  *Control yourself, Weiss,* she thought, the words a sharp reprimand echoing in the vast emptiness of her mind. *Analyze. Assess. Adapt.*

Blake Belladonna’s ears twitched, her Faunus senses acutely aware of every shift in the wind, every grain of sand displaced by the unseen currents of air. The scent of the desert, a mixture of parched earth and the faint, metallic tang of distant conflict, filled her nostrils. Her eyes, accustomed to the softer light of the Ever After, struggled to adjust to the harsh glare of the Vacuan sun. A low growl rumbled in her chest, a primal response to the unfamiliar, potentially hostile environment.  Her hand instinctively went to Gambol Shroud, the familiar weight a small comfort in the overwhelming disorientation.  *Where are we?* she thought, her mind already racing, cataloging potential threats and escape routes. *Are we safe?* Her gaze swept over her teammates, searching for any sign of injury or distress.  A flicker of concern, sharp and insistent, tightened her chest.  *Yang…*

Yang Xiao Long felt…wrong. The phantom weight of her arm, the one she’d lost and regained in a realm beyond comprehension, throbbed with a dull ache. The prosthetic, though seamlessly integrated, felt foreign and heavy.  A wave of frustration, hot and prickly, washed over her. The desert heat intensified the discomfort, clinging to her like a second skin.  She clenched her fist, the metal of Ember Celica cool against her palm. A low growl escaped her lips, a visceral expression of her unease.  *Damn it,* she thought, the words a raw, unfiltered burst of emotion.  *I just want answers.*  Her gaze landed on Ruby, her younger sister, and a surge of protectiveness washed over her, momentarily eclipsing her own discomfort.  *We need to get her out of this sun.*

Jaune Arc stood amidst the swirling sand, a quiet anchor in the storm of their disorientation.  The Ever After had changed him, aged him in ways that went beyond the mere passage of time.  He felt the weight of his experiences, the burden of leadership he’d carried, settle upon his shoulders like a heavy cloak.  He drew a slow, deep breath, the dry air burning in his lungs, but the familiar discomfort was oddly grounding.  He looked at his teammates, his friends, each lost in their own private struggle with the sudden shift in reality. Grief, a constant companion since Pyrrha’s death, resonated within him, but it was tempered by a newfound resolve. He was back.  They were back. And there was still work to be done. *We need to get our bearings,* he thought, his mind already beginning to assess their situation, to formulate a plan. *We need to figure out what happened… and what happens next.*

"Ruby?" Weiss's voice, strained and hesitant, broke the silence.

Ruby blinked, the sound pulling her back from the swirling vortex of her thoughts. "Weiss?" she echoed, her voice thin and reedy. "Is… is this real?"

"I… believe so," Weiss replied, her gaze sweeping over the desolate landscape.  "Though I confess, I wouldn’t mind waking up from this particular nightmare."

"It's… hot," Yang muttered, wiping a bead of sweat from her brow.  "And everything…itches."

Blake nodded, her ears still twitching nervously.  "I can hear… something.  Metal.  Stressed metal."

Jaune straightened, his hand instinctively going to Crocea Mors.  "Where?"

Blake tilted her head, listening intently.  "That way," she said, pointing towards a shimmering dune in the distance.  "Faint, but… there."

A shared look of understanding passed between them.  The disorientation remained, a heavy fog clinging to their minds, but a sense of purpose, however tenuous, began to emerge.  They moved as a unit, their steps hesitant at first, then gradually gaining confidence as they navigated the shifting sands. The heat shimmered around them, distorting the landscape, making the distant dune appear to float in the air.  The silence of the desert was broken only by the crunch of their boots on the sand, the whisper of the wind, and the ragged rhythm of their breathing.


As they crested the dune, a glint of metal caught Weiss’s eye.  Half-buried in the sand, its hull scarred and scorched, lay a wrecked transport skiff, its crimson and gold markings barely visible beneath a layer of dust. The scene spoke of a desperate struggle – scorch marks marred the sand surrounding the skiff, deep claw gashes ripped through the metal hull, and crates of supplies lay scattered amongst the debris.  A chilling silence hung in the air, broken only by the mournful howl of the wind.

“Shade Academy,” Weiss breathed, her voice barely audible above the wind.

Ruby’s eyes widened. “A Grimm attack?”


“Recent,” Blake confirmed, her gaze fixed on a set of tracks leading away from the wreckage.  “Both human and… Grimm.”

Yang’s hand tightened on Ember Celica.  “Survivors?”

“Perhaps,” Jaune said, his voice grim.  “Let’s be cautious.”

They approached the skiff cautiously, their weapons drawn. Ruby and Jaune took the lead, assessing the situation with practiced efficiency. Weiss, her analytical mind already at work, examined the damage to the skiff, noting the depth of the claw marks, the type of scorch patterns.  Blake, moving with a predator’s grace, followed the tracks, her senses alert for any sign of life, friend or foe.  Yang, her protective instincts flaring, formed the rear guard, her eyes scanning the surrounding dunes for any sign of movement.

The cockpit was a scene of chaos.  The controls were mangled, the windshield shattered, and bloodstains stained the seats.  A single datapad lay on the floor, its screen flickering faintly.  Jaune picked it up carefully, his fingers brushing against the still-warm surface.  He pressed a button, and the screen flickered to life, displaying a single, chilling image: a grainy, incomplete video transmission of a young woman, her face pale with terror, her voice choked with fear.  The transmission cut out abruptly, replaced by static.
