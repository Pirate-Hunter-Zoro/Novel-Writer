**(Section 1-C: The Wreckage)**

The shimmering mirage solidified into stark reality.  A Shade Academy transport skiff, half-swallowed by the unforgiving dune, lay before them like a beached leviathan. The glint Ruby had seen was sunlight reflecting off fractured metal, a cruel parody of a beacon.  With renewed resolve hardening her features, she signaled the advance. They moved as a single unit, a phantom limb of muscle memory reasserting itself.  Weiss, a spear point of focused energy, took the lead, her glyphs shimmering faintly under her boots, propelling her forward with controlled bursts of speed. Blake flanked her, a shadow flitting across the undulating sand, her Faunus senses heightened, filtering the whispers of the wind for any hint of danger.  Yang, a bulwark of raw power, brought up the rear, her gaze sweeping the horizon, a predator anticipating an ambush.  Jaune, his presence a quiet anchor, moved in their midst, his hand instinctively resting on the hilt of Crocea Mors, his newfound maturity a stark contrast to the nervous energy that had once plagued him.

The air grew heavy with the metallic tang of blood as they neared the wreckage. The heat, radiating from the sand and the battered hull, pressed against them like a physical force. Ruby could feel the grit between her teeth, the dryness in her throat. The unreality of Ever After was fading, replaced by the stark, visceral reality of this desolate scene.

Deep scorch marks, black and angry against the hull’s silver paint, told a story of desperate defense.  Massive gouges, ragged tears in the metal, spoke of claws the size of scythes.  Weiss ran a gloved hand along one of the gashes, her brow furrowed in concentration.  "Manticore," she murmured, her voice tight.  "Judging by the size and depth of these marks, a large one, perhaps even an Elder."  The words echoed Ruby's own assessment.

Scattered cargo littered the sand: shattered crates of Dust, their contents leaking vibrant, volatile colors into the pale grains; medical supplies, trampled and useless; personal effects, ripped and scattered like fallen leaves.  A tattered teddy bear, stained with crimson, lay half-buried in the sand, a silent testament to lives abruptly ended. The sight sent a shiver down Ruby’s spine.  *How many…?* she thought, her stomach twisting.  *How many didn’t make it?* The weight of leadership, the responsibility for her team’s safety, settled heavily on her shoulders.

Blake crouched low, her feline eyes scanning the disturbed sand. Her fingers, lightly tracing the patterns in the grit, picked out the subtle differences between human and Grimm tracks.  The chaotic scramble of footprints, etched deep into the sand, spoke of panicked flight. The overlaying Grimm tracks, large and predatory, painted a grim picture of the chase.  "There are signs of a struggle," she said, her voice hushed, "but… I can't be certain if anyone escaped." Hope and dread warred within Ruby.  A glimmer of possibility against the crushing weight of the evidence.

Yang, her fists clenched, paced restlessly around the perimeter, a coiled spring of tension.  The muscles in her arms bunched and flexed with barely restrained power.  Her gaze, sharp and unwavering, scanned the shimmering horizon, searching for any flicker of movement, any hint of a returning threat.  The simmering frustration radiating from her was palpable. *Not again,* Ruby heard her sister’s voice echo in her head, the raw, visceral grief barely contained. *Not another needless loss.*

Jaune stood beside Ruby, his expression unreadable.  He said nothing, but his silence spoke volumes. The lines etched around his eyes hinted at the profound internal processing taking place behind his stoic facade.  He’d seen too much death, too much loss.  Yet, a newfound maturity, a quiet strength, emanated from him, a testament to the trials he had endured. His hand tightened on his sword hilt, a silent promise of protection.  Ruby caught his eye, and a flicker of understanding passed between them.  They were no longer the naive children they had once been.

The cockpit door, breached and twisted inward, gaped open like a maw, inviting them into the wreckage's dark heart.  The decision hung heavy in the air, unspoken yet unanimous. They had assessed the exterior, gathered what information they could. Now, they needed to know the fate of those within. Ruby swallowed, the dry air catching in her throat.  The physical sensations of their return, the weight of gravity, the familiar ache in her muscles, grounded her in the present. This was real. This was happening.  "Let's go," she said, her voice firm despite the tremor of apprehension that ran through her. The time for speculation was over.  The time for answers had come.
